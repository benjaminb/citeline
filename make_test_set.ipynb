      "0 1. INTRODUCTION The solar chemical composition is a fundamental yardstick in astronomy, to which the elemental abundances of essentially all cosmic objects, be they planets, stars, nebulae or galaxies, are anchored. \n",
      "1 The importance of having accurate solar elemental abundances thus can not be overstated. \n",
      "2 From the pioneering efforts of Russell (1929) , Suess Urey (1956) , and Goldberg, Müller Aller (1960) to the more recent works of Anders Grevesse (1989) , Grevesse Sauval (1998) , Lodders (2003) , Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , Grevesse, Asplund Sauval (2007) , and Lodders, Palme Gail (2009) , compilations of the Solar System abundances have found extremely wide-ranging use in astronomy and cosmology. \n",
      "3 There are two independent and complementary ways of determining the Solar System abundances, each with its pros and cons. \n",
      "4 Through mass spectroscopy of meteorites in terrestrial laboratories, it is possible to directly measure the abundance of almost every element and isotope with remarkable precision. \n",
      "5 The most pristine meteorites are the so-called CI chondrites, which have been modified least by various physical and chemical processes over the past 4.56 Gyr. \n",
      "6 Even in these meteorites volatile elements have been depleted to various degrees, including the six most abundant elements: H, He, C, N, O and Ne. \n",
      "7 As a consequence, it is not possible to rely on meteorites to determine the primordial Solar System abundances for such elements. \n",
      "8 This also implies that one must measure all meteoritic abundances relative to an element other than H, traditionally chosen to be Si. \n",
      "9 Prior knowledge of the solar photospheric Si abundance is therefore required in order to place the meteoritic abundances on the same absolute scale as the Sun ( Suess Urey 1956 ). \n",
      "10 With the exception of a general ∼10% modification owing to diffusion and gravitational settling and depletion of Li and possibly Be, today's photospheric abundances are believed to reflect those at the birth of the Solar System. \n",
      "11 They are of profound importance for the understanding of our own Solar System and the Sun's interior structure and evolution. \n",
      "12 Unfortunately, photospheric abundances cannot be determined with the same accuracy as those from meteorites. \n",
      "13 In particular, very little isotopic abundance information is available. \n",
      "14 Furthermore, photospheric abundances are not observed but inferred. \n",
      "15 Thus, the solar spectrum must be interpreted using realistic models of the solar atmosphere and spectrum-formation process. \n",
      "16 In addition, the required atomic and molecular data are rarely precise enough to rival the accuracy of meteoritic measurements. \n",
      "17 In spite of the remaining uncertainties in solar photospheric determinations, having access to the most accurate solar abundances possible is crucial, not only for understanding our own Sun but also in order to make meaningful comparisons with other stars (for which meteoritic information is obviously unavailable). \n",
      "18 The Sun is also the only possible reference for the interstellar medium, H ii regions, and other galaxies when studying the elements depleted in meteorites. \n",
      "19 In the decade since the appearance of the widely used compilation of the solar chemical composition by Grevesse Sauval (1998) , the abundances of a large number of elements have been revised, several rather severely (e.g., Asplund, Grevesse Sauval 2005 ). \n",
      "20 This is true in particular for C, N, O, and Ne. \n",
      "21 There are three main reasons for the changes: improvements in atomic and molecular transition probabilities, the advent of 3D hydrodynamical solar model atmospheres, and relaxation of the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the spectral line formation. \n",
      "22 Several of the proposed abundance alterations have not gone unchallenged, however. \n",
      "23 It is therefore timely to now critically assess the reference solar chemical composition and make recommendations regarding the most accurate values available to the astronomical community. \n",
      "24 After recapitulating the necessary ingredients in any solar abundance analysis (Section 2), we discuss in detail the solar chemical composition on an element-by-element basis (Section 3). \n",
      "25 We also present a comparison between photospheric solar abundances and those inferred by alternative means, such as via meteorites and stars or gas in the Solar Neighborhood (Section 4). \n",
      "26 We conclude by summarizing the main points and outlining a few open issues for the future (Section 5). \n",
      "27 2. INGREDIENTS FOR SOLAR ABUNDANCE ANALYSIS 2.1. \n",
      "28 Observations Analyses of the solar photospheric chemical composition make use of the elemental fingerprints present in the solar spectrum in the form of spectral absorption lines. \n",
      "29 There are several solar atlases of both intensity and flux spectra in the UV, optical, and IR regions. \n",
      "30 The most commonly used optical disk-center intensity spectra of the quiet Sun are the so-called Jungfraujoch or Liège atlas (after its locations of observation and production, respectively; Delbouille, Roland Neven 1973 ) and the Kitt Peak solar atlas ( Neckel Labs 1984 ). \n",
      "31 The spectral resolving power of the latter is slightly higher, whereas the former is less affected by telluric absorption owing to the higher observing altitude. \n",
      "32 There are also corresponding IR disk-center intensity atlases observed from Kitt Peak ( Delbouille et al. 1981 ) and from the Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS ) experiment flown on the space shuttle ( Farmer Norton 1989 ; Abrams et al. 1996 ). \n",
      "33 Finally, the solar flux spectrum has recently been rereduced by Kurucz (2006) ; see also Kurucz et al. (1984) for an earlier rendition of the same Kitt Peak solar data set. \n",
      "34 All solar atlases agree very well with each other except for spectral regions afflicted by telluric features. \n",
      "35 Thus, the quality of observations is in general not a source of significant error in solar abundance analyses. \n",
      "36 2.2. \n",
      "37 Atomic and Molecular Data A critical ingredient in any solar abundance analysis is, of course, the atomic and molecular line input data. \n",
      "38 Of these the transition probability is the most obvious, but there are a raft of other required components that are not always as well determined as one would hope. \n",
      "39 These include line broadening, hyperfine and isotopic splitting, dissociation energies, and partition functions. \n",
      "40 Much laudable work has been done in improving the gf -values for a large number of transitions (e.g., Kurucz 1992 ; Johansson et al. 2003 ; Lawler et al. 2006 ; Sobeck, Lawler Sneden 2007 ), but several elements and lines still have surprisingly uncertain transition probabilities. \n",
      "41 Another important advancement in recent years is that it is now possible to accurately compute the pressure broadening (also known as van der Waals broadening) of metal lines ( Anstee O'Mara 1995 ; Barklem, Piskunov O'Mara 2000a ; Barklem Aspelund-Johansson 2005 ), which has made the classical Unsöld broadening and its ad hoc enhancement factors largely obsolete, at least for neutral species. \n",
      "42 The need for atomic data increases dramatically when relaxing the LTE assumption. \n",
      "43 In non-LTE calculations, one needs transition data not only for the line in question but in principle for all other lines of the element. \n",
      "44 In addition, photoionization cross sections play a crucial role. \n",
      "45 There have been noteworthy improvements in this respect in recent years through the Opacity and Iron Projects ( Badnell et al. 2005 ), for example, but unfortunately the lack of quantum mechanical calculations for most elements preclude detailed non-LTE investigations. \n",
      "46 The most unsatisfactory situation, however, relates to collisional cross sections for excitation and ionization, for which laboratory or theoretical calculations are completely missing bar for a few elements and transitions relevant for spectroscopy of late-type stars (e.g., Belyaev Barklem 2003 ; Barklem 2007a ). \n",
      "47 In the absence of realistic evaluations, classical recipes such as those of van Regemorter (1962) and Drawin (1968) are frequently used but cannot be expected to be more than order-of-magnitude estimates at best. \n",
      "48 Often scaling factors to these formulas are used, sometimes calibrated by achieving an optimal overall fit to the various spectral features. \n",
      "49 It should be remembered that such a procedure may reveal less about the true collisional cross sections than about other shortcomings in the modeling of the stellar atmospheres and line formation ( Asplund 2005 ). \n",
      "50 2.3. \n",
      "51 Solar Atmospheric and Line-Formation Modeling Extracting information about the Sun's chemical composition from the solar spectrum requires realistic models of the solar atmosphere and the line-formation process. \n",
      "52 Traditional solar and stellar abundance analyses employ one-dimensional (1D) model atmospheres assuming time-independence and hydrostatic equilibrium. \n",
      "53 Such models come in two flavors: theoretical and semiempirical. \n",
      "54 The former are constructed assuming a constant total (radiative plus convective) energy flux through the atmosphere, which dictates the temperature stratification given the adopted equation of state and opacities. \n",
      "55 Convective energy transport is normally described by the mixing length theory ( Böhm-Vitense 1958 ). \n",
      "56 The radiative flux is determined by solving the radiative transfer equation, typically under the simplification of LTE. \n",
      "57 To achieve a realistic temperature structure, treatment of the combined effects of spectral lines (line blanketing) must be as complete as possible. \n",
      "58 The most widely used theoretical 1D model atmospheres for solar-type stars are the Kurucz (1993) and MARCS ( Gustafsson et al. 2008 ) grids of models. \n",
      "59 Semiempirical models are often the preferred choice for solar spectroscopists. \n",
      "60 In these models, temperatures are inferred from depth-dependent observations such as the center-to-limb variation of the continuum and/or lines with differing formation heights. \n",
      "61 The resulting atmospheric structure is, thus, sensitive to the ingredients involved in the inversion process, such as LTE for the continuum and line formation, and the adopted line data. \n",
      "62 Hydrostatic equilibrium is still assumed in semiempirical models, but the flux constancy criterion does not need to be obeyed nor is it necessary to estimate convective energy transport. \n",
      "63 Several semiempirical solar models are on the market, including the Holweger Müller (1974) , VAL3C ( Vernazza, Avrett Loeser 1976 ), and MISS ( Allende Prieto et al. 2001 ) models. \n",
      "64 The favored model of solar abundance aficionados is the Holweger Müller model, partially because its temperature stratification is expected to be an accurate representation of the real photosphere—but also partially just by habit. \n",
      "65 Indeed, it is somewhat surprising that the VAL3C model or its successors (e.g., Fontenla et al. 2006 ) have not caught on more within the solar abundance community, because they are built on similar premises but without the LTE restriction. \n",
      "66 The venerable Holweger Müller model, in fact, dates back more than forty years, since the 1974 version was simply a new pressure-integration of the original Holweger (1967) model using updated equation of state and continuous opacities. \n",
      "67 It was constructed to match the observed continuum center-to-limb variation as well as the line-depths of some 900 lines of varying strengths, under the assumption of LTE. \n",
      "68 Owing to the limited spectral resolution of the solar spectrum used by Holweger, one would expect the temperatures to be overestimated by about 50 K in the line-forming region. \n",
      "69 Interestingly, the corrected version of such a temperature structure would be more similar to the MISS semiempirical model ( Allende Prieto et al. 2001 ); both semiempirical models have a shallower temperature gradient than 1D theoretical model atmospheres, as seen in Figure 1 . \n",
      "70 Bear in mind that there exists an ambiguity when employing any 1D model: Although many simply adopt temperatures, pressures, and densities directly from the published model, a more correct procedure is to perform a pressure-integration using only the temperature structure as a function of continuum optical depth, in order to be consistent with the opacities computed with the spectrum synthesis code one employs. \n",
      "71 Figure 1 The mean temperature structure of the 3D hydrodynamical model of Trampedach et al. (in preparation) used throughout this review is shown as a function of optical depth at 500 nm ( blue solid line ). \n",
      "72 The light blue shaded region corresponds to the spatial and temporal root mean square variations of the 3D model, whereas the red and yellow curves denote the 1D semiempirical Holweger Müller (1974) and the 1D theoretical MARCS ( Gustafsson et al. 2008 ) model atmospheres, respectively. \n",
      "73 More recently it has become tractable to perform 3D, time-dependent, hydrodynamical simulations of the stellar surface convection (e.g., Stein Nordlund 1998 ; Asplund et al. 1999 ; Freytag, Steffen Dorch 2002 ; Vögler, Bruls Schüssler 2004 ). \n",
      "74 Here the standard conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy are solved together with the 3D radiative transfer equation in a small but representative volume of the stellar atmosphere. \n",
      "75 Radiative energy exchange with the gas in the surface layers is crucial, because this is what drives the convective motions. \n",
      "76 Because of the much more computationally demanding nature of such hydrodynamical modeling, approximations must be made in the radiative transfer treatment. \n",
      "77 Rather than solving for many thousands of frequency points as regularly done in theoretical 1D hydrostatic models, the wavelength variation of opacity is represented by a small number of typical opacity bins (4–20) in order to compute the radiative heating/cooling rate that enters the energy equation ( Nordlund 1982 ). \n",
      "78 Detailed comparisons with the monochromatic solution reveal that this scheme is surprisingly accurate. \n",
      "79 The reader is referred to Nordlund, Stein Asplund (2009) for a recent review of the physics of solar surface convection and the numerical details of its simulation. \n",
      "80 A few different 3D hydrodynamical solar model atmospheres have been constructed and employed for abundance purposes (e.g., Asplund et al. 2000b ; Caffau et al. 2008a ; Trampedach et al., in preparation). \n",
      "81 Although these are computed with different codes, they are based on many of the same physical assumptions and approximations. \n",
      "82 It is therefore not too surprising that the resulting atmospheric structures are similar. \n",
      "83 The 3D models have been computed using realistic and comprehensive equation of state, continuous and line opacities. \n",
      "84 The numerical resolution is sufficiently high to adequately resolve the granulation, albeit obviously not high enough to reach down to the microscopic viscous dissipation length scales. \n",
      "85 The reason that these so-called large-eddy simulations are nevertheless quite successful in reproducing the real photosphere is that the mean stratification is largely independent of numerical resolution ( Stein Nordlund 1998 ; Asplund et al. 2000a ). \n",
      "86 Spectral line formation is heavily biased to the upflows, which have a low degree of turbulence in comparison to the downflows, owing to the divergent flow. \n",
      "87 Obviously none of the mixing length parameters required in 1D models enters into 3D simulations, as the convective energy flux is instead a natural consequence of the hydrodynamics. \n",
      "88 Having a suitably realistic solar model atmosphere, the next step when trying to infer the solar chemical composition is to model how the spectrum is formed. \n",
      "89 In order to derive an abundance of an element, solar spectroscopists either measure the total observed line strength as defined by the equivalent width, or directly compare the observed and theoretical spectra through the fitting of line profiles. \n",
      "90 Finally, to compute the line strength requires knowledge of the level populations. \n",
      "91 In LTE, these follow straightforwardly from the local temperature and electron pressure using the Boltzmann and Saha distributions. \n",
      "92 In general, this rather severe simplification cannot be expected to be valid, and the non-LTE case must instead be considered. \n",
      "93 Although non-LTE is a general term covering all situations when LTE is not valid, in practice all calculations referred to herein assume statistical equilibrium, that is, the level populations do not change with time. \n",
      "94 Non-LTE thus requires a simultaneous solution of the rate equations for all relevant levels and species together with the radiative transfer equation for all relevant wavelengths. \n",
      "95 We refer to Asplund (2005) for a detailed account of the principles of non-LTE and the most important non-LTE effects encountered for late-type stars like the Sun. \n",
      "96 2.4. \n",
      "97 Observational Constraints on Solar Modeling Because more sophisticated modeling does not automatically imply a more realistic outcome, it is of paramount importance to carefully test the predictions of the 3D model atmospheres against an arsenal of observational diagnostics. \n",
      "98 This is especially true given that 1D model atmospheres more often than not fail the very same tests. \n",
      "99 Current generations of 3D models are very successful in reproducing the observed solar granulation topology, typical length- and timescales, convective velocities, and intensity brightness contrast (e.g., Nordlund, Stein Asplund 2009 ), clearly none of which 1D models are able to predict. \n",
      "100 Another important constraint is the center-to-limb variation of the continuum as a function of wavelength. \n",
      "101 Ayres, Plymate Keller (2006) have criticized the 3D hydrodynamical model of Asplund et al. (2000b) , ofen used in recent solar abundance analyses, for having too steep a temperature gradient as judged by the observed center-to-limb variation. \n",
      "102 Koesterke, Allende Prieto Lambert (2008) reach a somewhat milder conclusion, presumably because they performed spectral synthesis with the full 3D model rather than with only the spatially averaged version used by Ayres, Plymate Keller. \n",
      "103 The 3D CO5BOLD solar model of Caffau et al. (2008a) appears to perform better in this respect (H. Ludwig, private communication). \n",
      "104 In the present work, we make extensive use of a new 3D solar model (Trampedach et al., in preparation), which has been constructed with an improved treatment of the radiative transfer and updated opacities. \n",
      "105 Because of its somewhat shallower temperature stratification than the 3D model of Asplund et al. (2000b) ( Figure 1 ), the new 3D model satisfies the center-to-limb variation constraint very well, as illustrated in Figure 2 . \n",
      "106 Indeed it outperforms all 1D models, even the semiempirical Holweger Müller (1974) model, which was designed to fit this diagnostic. \n",
      "107 Figure 2 Comparison of the predicted continuum center-to-limb variation as a function of wavelength for different solar model atmospheres against observations ( Neckel Labs 1994 ). \n",
      "108 The results for five different viewing angles μ are shown from near disk center ( μ = 0.9) to close to the limb ( μ = 0.1). \n",
      "109 All intensities are normalized to the corresponding disk-center intensities. \n",
      "110 The 3D hydrodynamical model (Trampedach et al., in preparation) used in this review outperforms even the Holweger Müller (1974) semiempirical model, which was designed to satisfy this diagnostic (Pereira et al., in preparation). \n",
      "111 As for all 1D theoretical model atmospheres, the MARCS ( Gustafsson et al. 2008 ) model has a too steep temperature gradient, which manifests itself in a poor agreement with the center-to-limb variation. \n",
      "112 The wings of the H i Balmer lines are also sensitive tracers of the temperature stratification in the deeper layers of the photosphere. \n",
      "113 In recent years, significant improvements have been made in the treatment of the broadening of H i lines, especially self-broadening ( Barklem, Piskunov O'Mara 2000b ; Allard et al. 2008 ). \n",
      "114 It is still unclear whether noticeable non-LTE effects can be expected in the solar atmosphere, because available calculations for the cross sections of inelastic H+H collisions are uncertain ( Barklem 2007b ). \n",
      "115 With 1D theoretical model atmospheres, the H i lines imply too low T eff for the Sun by 50–100 K and have the wrong line shapes when the most accurate line broadening data are used ( Barklem et al. 2002 ). \n",
      "116 Such problems can be partly cured by playing with the mixing length parameters, however. \n",
      "117 In contrast, the H i lines suggest that the temperature gradient of the Holweger Müller (1974) semiempirical model is too shallow. \n",
      "118 The 3D solar model that we make extensive use of in this review reproduces the H α and H β lines very well, doing so significantly better than any 1D model investigated, but without requiring the tweaking of any free parameters. \n",
      "119 The CO5BOLD model has, to our knowledge, not yet been tested against H i lines. \n",
      "120 As seen in Figure 3 , with 3D hydrodynamical models for the solar atmosphere, it is now possible to achieve highly satisfactory agreement with observed profiles of typical weak and intermediate strong lines (the wings of strong lines reveal more about the pressure broadening data than the employed model atmosphere). \n",
      "121 It is important to remember that this is achieved without invoking the free parameters necessary in any 1D analysis (micro- and macroturbulence) in the line-formation calculations. \n",
      "122 Such line broadening can thus be explained as the result of the Doppler shifts arising from the convective motions with a smaller contribution from the solar oscillations (e.g., Nordlund, Stein Asplund 2009 , and references therein). \n",
      "123 Indeed, even the observed line shifts and asymmetries are very well reproduced with 3D models (e.g., Asplund et al. 2000b ). \n",
      "124 The CO5BOLD solar model produces good overall line profiles (e.g., Caffau et al. 2008a ), but whether this extends also to line asymmetries has not yet been investigated. \n",
      "125 Figure 3 The predicted spectral line profile of a typical Fe i line from the 3D hydrodynamical solar model ( blue solid line ) compared to the observations ( gray rhombuses ). \n",
      "126 The agreement is clearly very satisfactory, which is the result of the Doppler shifts arising from the self-consistently computed convective motions that broaden, shift, and skew the theoretical profile. \n",
      "127 For comparison purposes, also shown is the predicted profile from a 1D model atmosphere ( red line ; Holweger Müller 1974 ); the 1D profile has been computed with a microturbulence of 1 km s −1 and a tuned macroturbulence to obtain the right overall linewidth. \n",
      "128 Note that even with these two free parameters, the 1D profile can predict neither the shift nor the asymmetry of the line. \n",
      "129 In summary, the 3D hydrodynamical model atmosphere that we draw results from in this review outperforms 1D model atmospheres in the available observational tests, from granulation topology and center-to-limb variation to H i lines and the detailed profiles of metallic lines. \n",
      "130 For the purposes of photospheric abundance determinations, the 3D solar model employed here appears to be a very realistic representation of the solar photosphere. \n",
      "131 No large differences are expected from using our 3D model or the corresponding CO5BOLD model ( Caffau et al. 2008a ) given their overall similarities. \n",
      "132 3. PHOTOSPHERIC ABUNDANCES Our recommended solar photospheric elemental abundances are listed in Table 1 , which also provides the corresponding meteoritic values for CI chondrites to be discussed in Section 4.1. \n",
      "133 [Throughout this review, we adopt the customary astronomical scale for logarithmic abundances where H is defined to be log ε H = 12.00, that is, log ε X = log( N X / N H ) + 12, where N X and N H are the number densities of elements X and H, respectively.] Figure 4 shows how the solar abundances vary with atomic number, illustrating several key features of nuclear and stellar physics: the high primordial H and He abundances; the fragile nature of Li, Be, and B; the relatively high abundance of elements involved in stellar H-, He-, and C-burning, modulated by the odd-even effect and the α -capture effect; the high nuclear binding energy and near-nuclear statistical equilibrium for the Fe-peak; and the production of the heavy elements through successive neutron captures with peaks around the magic nuclei possessing closed neutron shells (e.g., Pagel 1997 ). \n",
      "134 Table 1 Element abundances in the present-day solar photosphere. \n",
      "135 Also given are the corresponding values for CI carbonaceous chondrites ( Lodders, Palme Gail 2009 ). \n",
      "136 Indirect photospheric estimates have been used for the noble gases (Section 3.9) Figure 4 The present-day solar photospheric elemental abundances as a function of atomic number. \n",
      "137 As throughout this review, the logarithmic abundance of H is defined to be log ε H = 12.0. \n",
      "138 In this review, we have attempted to reanalyze the solar abundances of (nearly) all elements in a homogeneous manner with the best possible atomic data and state-of-the-art solar modeling. \n",
      "139 As a guiding principle, we have been very discerning when selecting the lines for each element, because inclusion of dubious lines only increases the abundance scatter and tends to skew the results toward higher abundances owing to blends. \n",
      "140 The analysis has been carried out using several 1D and 3D model atmospheres and with non-LTE effects accounted for whenever possible, all done with the same well-tested computer codes. \n",
      "141 Unless specified otherwise, the results presented here have been based on the new 3D hydrodynamical solar model atmosphere of Trampedach et al. (in preparation). \n",
      "142 Below we present in some detail how the abundances were derived but the full description of the analysis (including line lists with all relevant data for the transitions) will appear in a forthcoming series of articles in Astronomy Astrophysics (Asplund et al., in preparation; Grevesse et al., in preparation; Sauval et al., in preparation; Scott et al., in preparation). \n",
      "143 There are a wide range of potential sources of error in solar and stellar abundance analyses, from inaccurate input data for the transition ( gf -values, line broadening, etc.) to difficulties in estimating line strengths (finite signal-to-noise, continuum placement, blends, etc.), to inadequacies in the atmospheric and line-formation modeling (1D, LTE, mixing length and microturbulence parameters, continuous opacities, etc.). \n",
      "144 No consensus exists in the solar abundance literature on how the uncertainties should be quantified. \n",
      "145 Some researchers have used the standard deviation arising from the chosen sample of lines to represent the total error for a given species, while others have employed the standard error of the mean or some different measure altogether. \n",
      "146 Previous compilations of the solar chemical composition contained a mixture of different error estimates, because the values were taken from sources with differing modus operandi. \n",
      "147 We have attempted to quantify three possible systematic errors introduced by the modeling: mean atmospheric stratification, atmospheric inhomogeneities, and departures from LTE. \n",
      "148 The first uncertainty has been estimated by taking half the difference between the results with the spatially averaged 3D model (denoted 〈3D〉) and the Holweger Müller (1974) model. \n",
      "149 The second has been evaluated as half the difference between the full 3D results and those from 〈3D〉. \n",
      "150 The inclusion of the theoretical MARCS ( Gustafsson et al. 2008 ) and semiempirical MISS ( Allende Prieto et al. 2001 ) models serves as a further check on these two systematic errors. \n",

      "372 Our Fe i -based abundance of log ε Fe = 7.52 ± 0.05 ( σ = 0.03) from weak lines is slightly higher than in Asplund et al. (2000c) on account of a slightly shallower mean temperature structure in the new 3D model and allowance of departures from LTE (Scott et al., in preparation). \n",
      "373 The non-LTE abundance corrections have been estimated to be +0.03 dex for Fe i ( Korn, Shi Gehren 2003 , Collet, Asplund Thévenin 2005 ), although this depends on the still poorly known inelastic H collisions (see Asplund 2005 , and references therein). \n",

      "395 In a beautiful series of papers, they have systematically and methodically measured radiative lifetimes, branching fractions, oscillator strengths, isotopic shifts, and hyperfine constants for all the rare Earth elements: La ( Lawler, Bonvallet Sneden 2001 ); Ce ( Lawler et al. 2009 ); Pr ( Sneden et al. 2009 ); Nd ( Den Hartog et al. 2003 ); Sm ( Lawler et al. 2006 ); Eu ( Lawler et al. 2001b ); Gd ( Den Hartog et al. 2006 ); Tb ( Lawler et al. 2001a ); Dy ( Sneden et al. 2009 ); Ho ( Lawler, Sneden Cowan 2004 ); Er ( Lawler et al. 2008 ); Tm, Yb, and Lu ( Sneden et al. 2009 ). \n",
      "396 The group has also carried out a similar study for Hf ( Lawler et al. 2007 ). \n",
      "397 In their solar abundance analyses, they have employed the 1D Holweger Müller (1974) model atmosphere and assumed LTE for the spectrum synthesis. \n",
      "398 Although all the utilized transitions are from the majority ionization stage (once ionized) for the rare Earth elements, one still expects a minor temperature and, thus, model-atmosphere dependency, because the lines originate from atomic levels with low excitation potentials ( χ exc ≤ 1.5 eV). \n",
      "399 The recommended solar abundances provided in Table 1 for these elements have been modified from the original sources by calculating the abundance difference between a 3D hydrodynamical model atmosphere and the Holweger Müller (1974) model, each computed using the same line-formation code with consistent input data (Grevesse et al., in preparation). \n",
      "400 For the majority of these lines, such (3D-HM) abundance corrections amount to ≈−0.04 dex. \n",
      "401 In addition, the 1D non-LTE effects on Eu ii predicted by Mashonkina Gehren (2000) have been taken into account in the 3D result; non-LTE studies are not available for any other rare Earth elements. \n",
      "402 A similar procedure has been implemented for Cd ( Youssef, Doenszelmann Grevesse 1990 ), W ( Holweger Werner 1982 ), Os ( Quinet et al. 2006 ), Ir ( Youssef Khalil 1988 ), and Au ( Youssef 1986 ), all of which have only heavily blended transitions available in the solar spectrum, necessitating careful and time-consuming spectrum syntheses. \n",
      "403 Owing to blends, we consider the two As i lines employed by Gopka et al. (2001) too unreliable to base a meaningful abundance determination on and consequently do not provide a solar photospheric As abundance here. \n",
      "404 Similarly, we are unable to defend an estimate of the Sb abundance from the very weak and heavily perturbed, purported Sb i line at 323.2 nm reported by Ross Aller (1976) . \n",
      "405 For all other neutron capture elements (Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Sn, Ba, Pb, and Th), the adopted abundances come from a complete 3D-based reanalysis using the best atomic data and newly measured equivalent widths or spectrum synthesis for the most reliable lines (Grevesse et al., in preparation); the case of Ru is also discussed in Fivet et al. (2009) . \n",
      "406 The available 1D non-LTE abundance corrections for Zn i ( Takeda et al. 2005 ), Sr ii ( Mashonkina Gehren 2001 ), and Ba ii ( Mashonkina Gehren 2000 ) have been included in these estimates. \n",
      "407 For comparison purposes, we have also repeated the line calculations with an assortment of 1D model atmospheres. \n",
      "408 We have found very good agreement (0.02 dex) with recent studies using the Holweger Müller (1974) model when allowance is made for differences in adopted transition probabilities and equivalent widths for Ge ( Biémont et al. 1999 ), Sr ( Barklem O'Mara 2000 ), Pd ( Xu et al. 2006 ), and Pb ( Biémont et al. 2000 ). \n",

      "413 The 3D LTE abundance for Hf from Caffau et al. (2008b) is 0.02 dex higher than our corresponding value. \n",
      "414 As explained above, we have corrected the spectrum synthesis results of Lawler et al. (2007) for 3D effects rather than attempted to measure the equivalent widths of these weak and blended Hf ii lines as done by Caffau et al. (2008b) . \n",
      "415 Caffau et al. (2008b) also performed a detailed investigation using 3D line profile fitting of the Th ii 401.9-nm line, which is distorted by two Co i and V i lines (not V ii as stated in their paper), as well as being in the red wing of a relatively strong feature from Fe i and Ni i . \n",
      "416 Interestingly, they argued that it is important to take into account the line asymmetry of the Fe i +Ni i blend introduced by the convective motions (e.g., Asplund et al. 2000b ), which otherwise would lead to an overestimation of the Th abundance by ≈0.1 dex. \n",
      "417 Unfortunately, Caffau et al. (2008b) did not specify what abundances they used for the blending lines, so it is difficult to exactly reproduce their result; our value is consistent with that of Caffau et al. (2008b) , though smaller by 0.06 dex. \n",

      "423 We note that in the meantime a more reliable estimate of the solar Cl abundance may be provided by nearby H ii regions: log ε Cl = 5.32 ± 0.07 ( García-Rojas Esteban 2007 ). \n",

      "433 The result is quite insensitive to the reference solar model employed for the inversion, but does depend on the adopted equation of state. \n",
      "434 Basu Antia (2004) found a He mass fraction in the convection zone of Y s = 0.2485 ± 0.0034, which corresponds to a He abundance by number of log ε He = 10.93 ± 0.01. \n",
      "435 The uncertainty essentially reflects the difference between the MHD ( Mihalas, Däppen Hummer 1988 ) and OPAL ( Rogers Nayfonov 2002 ) equation of state, but there is also a minor dependency on the assumed metallicity of the reference solar model for the inversion ( Trampedach, Däppen Baturin 2006 ). \n",
      "436 A similar value is obtained when calibrating solar interior models to achieve the correct mass, luminosity, and radius at the present solar age, if the chemical composition of Grevesse Sauval (1998) is adopted and diffusion is considered. \n",
      "437 With the solar abundances of Table 1 , however, the calibrated protosolar He abundance implies a surface value lower than the helioseismic measurement by 0.02 dex. \n",
      "438 Such models are also in conflict with other helioseismological evidence such as the depth of the convection zone and the sound speed variation with depth, as discussed in Section 4.3. \n",

      "440 Neon. \n",
      "441 The Ne abundance can be inferred from X-ray and UV spectroscopy of the solar corona and solar flares as well as directly from the solar wind. \n",
      "442 The interpretation is, however, complicated by the so-called first ionization potential (FIP) effect: Elements with ionization potential χ ion 10 eV are enhanced in the upper solar atmosphere and solar wind compared to their photospheric values, whereas the high ionization elements are not or only slightly affected ( Feldman Widing 2003 ). \n",
      "443 Rather than measuring the Ne abundance directly, a common approach is to determine the abundance relative to a reference element and assume that the ratio is the same in the photosphere. \n",
      "444 Here O is the reference element of choice, although we note that there is still a significant difference in ionization potential between O (13.6 eV) and Ne (21.6 eV), which could potentially introduce a systematic error given our poor understanding of the physical reasons for the FIP effect. \n",
      "445 The degree of chemical separation varies significantly, being more severe in regions of higher solar activity. \n",
      "446 Young (2005b) found a Ne/O ratio of 0.175 ± 0.031 for the quiet Sun, which is the value we adopt here to convert our photospheric O abundance to a Ne content. \n",
      "447 This result is particularly appealing for our purposes because Young (2005a) has demonstrated that the average quiet Sun does not show any FIP effect, a conclusion that is further corroborated when using the solar abundances given herein. \n",
      "448 This ratio is consistent with the results of Schmelz et al. (2005) for active regions (0.175 ± 0.074) and for the solar wind (0.14 ± 0.03) by Bochsler (2007) . \n",
      "449 The corresponding ratio in solar energetic particles is very similar and remarkably constant: 0.152 ± 0.006 ( Reames 1999 ), which was adopted by Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) . \n",
      "450 In spite of its very small uncertainty, here we weight this result less than that from the quiet Sun owing to the potential modification through the FIP effect. \n",
      "451 Together with our recommended O abundance, the photospheric Ne abundance becomes log ε Ne = 7.93 ± 0.09. \n",
      "452 Our value is smaller than the solar flare determination (log ε Ne = 8.11 ± 0.12) by Landi, Feldman Doschek (2007) , but we consider the quiet Sun a more reliable indicator than solar flares owing to possible fractionation processes in the latter. \n",
      "453 Although the Ne abundance (log ε Ne = 7.96 ± 0.13) of Bochsler (2007) agrees with ours, there are significant additional uncertainties in this result on account of using He as a reference element, as it is known to be highly variable in the solar wind. \n",
      "454 Drake Testa (2005) have argued on the basis of X-ray spectroscopy of nearby stars that the Ne/O ratio is significantly higher (0.41) than the solar ratios discussed above. \n",
      "455 Their sample is, however, heavily biased toward active stars, which experience an inverse FIP effect: Elements with χ ion > 10 eV are enhanced in the corona compared to low ionization potential species ( Güdel 2004 ). \n",
      "456 Indeed, Robrade, Schmitt Favata (2008) show that there is a systematic trend in Ne/O with activity level such that other inactive stars have similar low ratios to the Sun. \n",
      "457 One would therefore suspect that the high coronal Ne/O ratio inferred by Drake Testa (2005) is a consequence of the difference in ionization potential, making Ne more susceptible to fractionation than O in high-activity environments. \n",
      "458 As is further discussed in Section 4.2, a more reliable stellar gauge of the solar Ne abundance is provided by OB stars in the Solar Neighborhood. \n",
      "459 Both the Ne/O ratio (0.20 ± 0.03) and the absolute Ne abundance (log ε Ne = 8.08 ± 0.03) estimated in this way are in very good agreement with the solar values we adopt here when the effects of solar diffusion and Galactic chemical enrichment over the past 4.5 Gyr are accounted for ( Przybilla, Nieva Butler 2008 ). \n",
      "460 3.9.3. \n",
      "461 Argon. \n",
      "462 As discussed in detail by Lodders (2008) , there are a wide range of methods for inferring the solar Ar abundance: solar wind measurements, solar flares and energetic particles, nuclear statistical equilibrium with the abundances of the nearby α -elements 28 S and 40 Ca, and comparison with other Solar System objects (Jupiter) and the Solar Neighborhood (B stars, planetary nebulae, H ii regions). \n",
      "463 We follow the procedure of Lodders (2008) but employ our preferred values for the photospheric abundances of O (for the solar wind, flares, and energetic particles), Kr, and Xe (for analyses of Jupiter), and the lower He abundance appropriate for the upper atmosphere instead of the photospheric value (for solar wind analyses). \n",
      "464 The quoted errors for all methods in the literature are only the dispersions of the measurements, and thus likely an underestimate of the true uncertainties. \n",
      "465 We therefore take a straight unweighted mean of all techniques, which leads to log ε Ar = 6.40 ± 0.13. \n",
      "466 Our value is 0.1 dex lower than the result of Lodders (2008) but 0.2 dex higher than Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , which was based only on the Ar/O ratio in solar energetic particles ( Reames 1999 ). \n",

      "469 The Kr abundance has been estimated from interpolation of the theoretical s -process production rates, because the cross sections for neutron capture of nearby pure s -isotopes have been accurately measured experimentally ( Palme Beer 1993 ). \n",
      "470 Our value accounts for a slight revision of the photospheric Si abundance, which serves as a normalization of the s -process predictions. \n",
      "471 This Kr estimate agrees well with the value inferred from the solar wind Kr/O ratio together with our photospheric O abundance ( Geiss, Gloeckler von Steiger 1994 ; Heber et al. 2008 ). \n",

      "474 The procedure to estimate the Xe content is the same as for Kr ( Käppeler 2005 ). \n",
      "475 For Xe, however, this s -process estimated value is 0.4 dex lower than deduced from the solar wind as measured from lunar regoliths ( Geiss, Gloeckler von Steiger 1994 ) and the Genesis space probe ( Heber et al. 2008 ). \n",
      "476 This may suggest that Xe has experienced fractionation through the FIP effect in spite of its relatively high ionization energy ( χ ion = 12.1 eV). \n",

      "478 Solar Isotopic Abundances As a convenience to the reader, in Table 3 we give our best estimates of the protosolar isotopic fractions for each element. \n",
      "479 In most cases, the terrestrial isotopic abundance ratios as recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( Rosman Taylor 1998 ) have been adopted as representative of the Solar System values; direct solar isotopic information can only be gleaned from CO vibration-rotation lines in the IR spectrum of the Sun (e.g., Scott et al. 2006 ), although with comparatively large error bars by terrestrial standards. \n",
      "480 It should be noted that except for C and O, the isotopic fractions given here are the more conservative “representative isotopic composition” values from the compilation of Rosman Taylor (1998) , in contrast to Lodders (2003) , who opted for the “best measurement from a single terrestrial source” data from the same reference. \n",
      "481 For most volatile elements more reliable isotopic fractions are available from alternative Solar System sources owing to strong depletion of terrestrial samples, as discussed below. \n",
      "482 Table 3 Representative isotopic abundance fractions in the Solar System. \n",
      "483 Most of the isotopic values are taken from Rosman Taylor (1998) with updates for some elements, as discussed in Section 3.10 The protosolar D abundance can be estimated from observations of Jupiter. \n",
      "484 Using Infrared Space Observatory spectra of the Jovian atmosphere and taking into account an expected 5–10% enrichment during the planet's formation, Lellouch et al. (2001) obtained a protosolar abundance of D/H = (2.1 ± 0.4) × 10 −5 . \n",
      "485 An alternative approach makes use of the measured enrichment of the 3 He/ 4 He ratio in the solar wind in comparison with the protosolar ratio 3 He/ 4 He = (1.66 ± 0.05) × 10 −4 inferred from Jupiter ( Mahaffy et al. 1998 ), because the additional 3 He can be attributed to D-burning in the Sun ( Gloeckler Geiss 2000 ). \n",
      "486 Together with the solar wind ratio 3 He/ 4 He = (4.53 ± 0.03) × 10 −4 from Genesis measurements ( Heber et al. 2008 ), the Jovian ratio implies D/H = (1.96 ± 0.03) × 10 −5 ; most of the uncertainty comes from the poorly known He fractionation in the solar wind. \n",
      "487 From the two methods, we finally estimate a protosolar abundance of D/H = (2.00 ± 0.2) × 10 −5 . \n",
      "488 This is consistent with the present-day local interstellar medium abundance ( Linsky et al. 2006 ), which implies only a small degree of astration over the past 4.5 Gyr. \n",
      "489 The 12 C/ 13 C ratio does not appear to vary significantly between different Solar System sources, so we simply adopt the accurate terrestrial reference value of Vienna Peeddee belemnite: 12 C/ 13 C = 89.4 ± 0.2 ( Coplen et al. 2002 ). \n",
      "490 We note that the representative isotopic composition from Rosman Taylor (1998) corresponds to the significantly more uncertain value 12 C/ 13 C = 92 ± 7. \n",
      "491 The ratio inferred from the solar photosphere using CO lines (86.8 ± 3.8) is consistent with the terrestrial value ( Scott et al. 2006 ). \n",
      "492 The 14 N/ 15 N ratio varies tremendously between various Solar System objects, from 100 to 450 ( Owen et al. 2001 ). \n",
      "493 Here we adopt the Jovian value 435 ± 57 as representative of the protosolar ratio, in agreement with values in the interstellar medium and carbonaceous chondrites ( Meibom et al. 2007 ). \n",
      "494 Oxygen isotopic abundances display a variability of up to a few percent within the Solar System. \n",
      "495 The best values to adopt for the protosolar O isotopic ratios are still debated (e.g., Hashizume Chaussidon 2005 , Ireland et al. 2006 ). \n",
      "496 The first results from the Genesis mission should appear very soon ( McKeegan et al. 2009 ), which will hopefully shed some light on the issue. \n",
      "497 Until such clarification, we adopt the terrestrial values represented in Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water: 16 O/ 18 O = 498.7 ± 0.1 and 16 O/ 17 O = 2632 ± 7 ( Coplen et al. 2002 ). \n",
      "498 The solar photospheric ratio 16 O/ 18 O = 479 ± 29 obtained by Scott et al. (2006) is consistent with the terrestrial value, but with larger uncertainties [although in fairness the terrestrial representative isotopic composition from Rosman Taylor (1998) is equally uncertain: 487 ± 35]. \n",
      "499 Surprisingly, Ayres, Plymate Keller (2006) found strongly subterrestrial ratios (e.g., 16 O/ 18 O = 440 ± 20) from their analysis of the solar CO lines, probably owing to an inadequate consideration of the differing temperature sensitivities of the isotopomer transitions with 1D model atmospheres ( Scott et al. 2006 ). \n",
      "500 Lines from 12 C 17 O are also visible in the solar IR spectrum, but owing to their extreme weakness their reliability as abundance indicators is questionable. \n",
      "501 For Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe we adopt the recommended values of Wieler (2002) derived from solar wind and lunar sample analyses. \n",
      "502 Very similar ratios have recently been presented from preliminary studies of solar wind samples from the Genesis mission ( Heber et al. 2008 ). \n",
      "503 For Mo, Dy, Er, Yb, and Lu we have exchanged the Rosman Taylor (1998) values with the more recent measurements given in Lodders, Palme Gail (2009) . \n",
      "504 Similarly the protosolar values given here for the radioactive nuclides have been taken from the same source. \n",
      "505 3.11. \n",
      "506 Conversion from Photospheric to Bulk Abundances The elemental abundances given in Table 1 are those currently present in the solar photosphere and, by extension, the whole convection zone. \n",
      "507 Owing to the combined effects of thermal diffusion, gravitational settling, and radiative acceleration (often referred to collectively as diffusion) over the past 4.56 Gyr, the values in Table 1 differ slightly from the protosolar chemical composition. \n",
      "508 In comparison with present-day photospheric values, the bulk composition of the Sun is higher by 0.05 dex for He and 0.04 dex for the heavier elements ( Turcotte Wimmer-Schweingruber 2002 ). \n",
      "509 The uncertainty in the overall diffusion correction is judged to be about 0.01 dex. \n",
      "510 The element-to-element variation in the expected diffusion is very small (0.01 dex) and, therefore, currently not observationally testable by a comparison of photospheric and meteoritic abundances. \n",
      "511 We note that Lodders (2003) adopted a somewhat larger correction, 0.074 dex, than that of Turcotte Wimmer-Schweingruber (2002) . \n",
      "512 She based her estimate on the results of Boothroyd Sackmann (2003) , who computed their solar models using a less detailed diffusion model. \n",
      "513 3.12. \n",
      "514 Solar Metallicity With the solar chemical composition we recommend here, the mass fractions of H, He, and metals in the present-day photosphere become X = 0.7381, Y = 0.2485, and Z = 0.0134. \n",
      "515 The respective values for the bulk composition are 0.7154, 0.2703, and 0.0142. \n",
      "516 In other words, the solar metallicity is no longer the canonical 2% recommended by Anders Grevesse (1989) but rather a substantially smaller 1.4%. \n",
      "517 Indeed, the intervening years have seen a steady decrease in Z / X from 0.027 to our preferred value of 0.018. \n",
      "518 This is illustrated in Table 4 , which collects the resulting mass fractions from a number of widely used compilations of the solar chemical composition over the past two decades. \n",
      "519 Our metallicity reverses this declining trend of Z with time by being slightly larger than advocated by Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , which is mainly the result of the somewhat higher C, N, O, Ne, and Fe abundances. \n",
      "520 Table 4 The mass fractions of H (X), He (Y) and metals (Z) for a number of widely used compilations of the solar chemical composition a The He abundances given in Anders Grevesse (1989) and Grevesse Noels (1993) have here been replaced with the current best estimate from helioseismology (Section 3.9). \n",
      "521 For completeness, we note that the He abundances recommended by Anders Grevesse (1989) and Grevesse Noels (1993) were based on calibration of solar models and, hence, corresponded to bulk composition; here we have substituted those with the helioseismic convection zone He content (Section 3.9) when computing the present-day photospheric values. \n",
      "522 Finally, from Table 4 it is clear that the surface He abundance employed by Lodders (2003) is too low on account of adopting a too efficient elemental diffusion. \n",
      "523 4. OTHER METHODS FOR INFERRING SOLAR ABUNDANCES 4.1. \n",
      "524 Meteorites Meteoritic data on the elemental abundances constitute an excellent comparator for the results from the solar photosphere presented above. \n",
      "525 Not all meteorites are suitable for the purpose though; only a very small subsample are believed to accurately reflect the chemical composition of the protosolar nebula, because the majority have undergone varying degrees of fractionation and alteration. \n",
      "526 The most primitive, undifferentiated meteorites in this respect are the so-called C I (or C1) carbonaceous chondrites, of which only five are known: the Alais, Ivuna (after which this class of meteorites is named), Orgueil, Revelstoke, and Tonk meteorites ( Lodders 2003 ). \n",
      "527 Of these, Orgueil is by far the largest and has therefore been exposed to the greatest number of analyses. \n",
      "528 It should be noted that while CI chondrites are believed not to have been noticeably chemically fractionated, they have still been severely modified mineralogically by aqueous alteration and thermal metamorphism. \n",
      "529 The main advantage of meteorites as a cosmic abundance standard is the extraordinarily high precision obtained, even for isotopic abundances, through mass spectroscopy. \n",
      "530 It comes at a cost, however, because the volatile elements H, C, N, O and the noble gases—which also happen to be the most abundant elements—have been severely depleted. \n",
      "531 As a consequence, the abundances in meteorites are pegged to the Si content, rather than H as is the case in solar and stellar spectroscopy. \n",
      "532 The mean abundances of CI chondrites presented in Table 1 have been appropriated from the data carefully compiled by Lodders, Palme Gail (2009) . \n",
      "533 To place the meteoritic abundances (defined as N Si = 10 6 ) on the same absolute scale as for the photosphere (defined as log ε H = 12.00), we have renormalized their data such that the meteoritic and photospheric Si abundances agree. \n",
      "534 The relation between the two scales is thus specified as log ε X = 1.51 + log N X . \n",
      "535 In principle, the conversion factor could employ additional elements besides Si; Anders Grevesse (1989) , for example, used Na, Mg, Si, Ca, V, Cr, Co, Ni, Y, Zr, Nb, and Mo, whereas Lodders, Palme Gail (2009) included as many as 39 elements. \n",
      "536 In practice, however, this does not change the result noticeably but it introduces some degree of arbitrariness into the selection of elements to include in this exercise. \n",
      "537 Figure 7 shows the difference between the thus obtained photospheric and CI chondrite abundances, highlighting the excellent correspondence between the two methods. \n",
      "538 Naturally all volatile elements are depleted in the meteorites, whereas Li is depleted in the solar photosphere. \n",
      "539 For the other 45 elements with a purported photospheric uncertainty less than 25%, the mean difference between photospheric and meteoritic abundances is 0.00 ± 0.05 dex. \n",
      "540 The photospheric and meteoritic abundances differ by more than the total combined uncertainty for only 10 out of the 57 nonvolatile elements (expected ≈18/57), which suggests that our estimated errors are in fact slightly too conservative. \n",
      "541 It should be emphasized that this excellent agreement cannot be interpreted as an absence of any significant diffusion in the Sun (Section 3.11), as the meteoritic scale is set by Si; all elements heavier than He are fractionated by ≈0.04 dex relative to H but hardly at all relative to each other. \n",
      "542 Figure 7 Difference between the logarithmic abundances determined from the solar photosphere and the CI carbonaceous chondrites as a function of atomic number. \n",
      "543 With a few exceptions, the agreement is excellent. \n",
      "544 Note that owing to depletion in the Sun and meteorites, the data points for Li, C, N, and the noble gases fall outside the range of the figure. \n",
      "545 In spite of the excellent agreement overall illustrated in Figure 7 , there are a few noticeable exceptions. \n",
      "546 Of the ten nondepleted elements where the solar and meteoritic abundances differ by more than 0.1 dex (25%), this can in all cases be blamed on uncertain photospheric analyses. \n",
      "547 Indeed, in some cases the two methods still agree within the combined errors (Cl, Au, Tl). \n",
      "548 We note a significant improvement for W compared to previous compilations of the solar chemical composition [Δlog ε = +0.49 dex in Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , whereas here the difference amounts to +0.20 dex]; we suspect that unidentified blends and/or erroneous continuum placement may be at fault for the persisting discrepancy, likewise for Rb and Hf. \n",
      "549 For Co we reckon that the non-LTE corrections by Bergemann (2008) are somewhat overestimated. \n",
      "550 The remaining three elements, Rh, Ag, and Pb, have had their photospheric values determined from transitions originating either in the ground state or from low-excitation levels of the neutral species (also true for Pd, W, and Au), which are prone to non-LTE effects in their excitation and ionization populations ( Asplund 2005 ). \n",
      "551 4.2. \n",
      "552 Solar Neighborhood Independent estimates of the chemical composition of the Sun are provided by solar-type stars, OB stars, H ii regions like the Orion nebula, and the interstellar medium in the Solar Neighborhood. \n",
      "553 In order to make a meaningful comparison one must first account for the effects of diffusion in the Sun and Galactic chemical enrichment. \n",
      "554 The former amounts to 0.04 dex for metals ( Turcotte Wimmer-Schweingruber 2002 ; cf. Section 3.11), whereas the latter is typically predicted to be 0.05–0.15 dex depending on the element in question ( Chiappini, Romano Matteucci 2003 ; Prantzos 2008 ). \n",
      "555 Whether the Sun is somehow special in its chemical composition relative to other FG dwarfs in the Galactic thin disk has attracted attention over the years (e.g., Gustafsson 2008 , Robles et al. 2008 , and references therein). \n",
      "556 We should bear in mind that most large-scale abundance analyses of Galactic thin disk stars to date (e.g., Edvardsson et al. 1993 ; Reddy et al. 2003 ; Bensby et al. 2005 ; Ramírez, Allende Prieto Lambert 2007 ; Fuhrmann 2008 ) have been performed differentially relative to the Sun to remove the uncertainties from gf -values and to minimize systematic errors due to inadequacies in the stellar modeling. \n",
      "557 These studies therefore reveal little about the absolute abundances of the stars but do imply that the Sun is a rather ordinary thin disk G dwarf for its age. \n",
      "558 In his volume-complete sample of stars within 25 pc, Fuhrmann (2008) found a mean spectroscopic metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.02 ± 0.18. \n",
      "559 Similarly, among the stars within 40 kpc having an isochrone age of 4–6 Gyr, Holmberg, Nordström Andersen (2008) obtained a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = −0.00 ± 0.10. \n",
      "560 In their study of 11 solar twins, Meléndez et al. (in preparation) found that the solar X/Fe ratios did not differ by more than 0.06 dex from the mean of the solar-twin sample for any of the 23 investigated elements. \n",
      "561 In the past, the Sun appeared to be metal-rich compared to, for example, young OB stars in the Solar Neighborhood, despite the expected chemical enrichment over the past 4.5 Gyr. \n",
      "562 In the meantime, the solar abundances have decreased and the hot star abundances have increased. \n",
      "563 The latter have also become more accurate, as reflected in greatly diminished uncertainties (e.g., Daflon Cunha 2004 , Nieva Przybilla 2006 , Morel 2008 ). \n",
      "564 Arguably the most accurate result to date is the analysis of Przybilla, Nieva Butler (2008) , who have carried out a non-LTE study of six nearby B-type main-sequence stars. \n",
      "565 Their results are presented in Table 5 ; for S we give the mean abundance from Morel et al. (2006) , whereas the Ar abundance is taken from Lanz et al. (2008) . \n",
      "566 When accounting for diffusion in the Sun, there is good agreement between the solar and hot star abundances for O, Ne, and Mg in particular. \n",
      "567 Although the situation has greatly improved compared to the solar abundances of Grevesse Sauval (1998) and earlier compilations, there is still a tendency for the solar C, N, and Fe abundances to be somewhat higher than in the B stars. \n",
      "568 It is unclear whether the solution can be found in the solar or B star analyses or, if a real difference indeed exists, perhaps due to infall of low-metallicity gas to the Solar Neighborhood or due to Galactic orbital migration ( Schönrich Binney 2009 ). \n",
      "569 Table 5 Comparison of the protosolar abundances with those in nearby B stars and HII regions a a The solar values given here include the effects of diffusion ( Turcotte Wimmer-Schweingruber 2002 ) as discussed in Section 3.11. \n",

      "577 The abundances of nearby H ii regions like the Orion nebula also provide constraints on the solar chemical composition. \n",
      "578 In Table 5 we provide the values from Esteban et al. (2004 , 2005) and García-Rojas Esteban (2007) interpolated to a Galacto-centric radius of 8 kpc. \n",
      "579 The observed scatter between individual H ii regions is now quite small, and the inferred present-day Galactic abundance gradient is well determined. \n",
      "580 It is worth remembering that there are multiple potential pitfalls in the analyses of H ii regions, including corrections for unseen ionization stages and the effects of temperature fluctuations in the nebula. \n",
      "581 Furthermore, abundances derived from recombination (permitted) lines are often significantly larger than the corresponding values from collisionally excited (forbidden) lines. \n",
      "582 Finally, dust condensation needs to be taken into account for some elements. \n",
      "583 For C and O this somewhat uncertain dust correction amounts to ≈0.1 dex in Orion ( Esteban et al. 2004 ). \n",
      "584 Volatile elements like Ne and S are not expected to form dust but refractory elements like Mg and Fe are predominantly in the solid phase, so it is therefore not possible to deduce a meaningful total elemental abundance for them. \n",
      "585 Overall, the agreement between the Sun and H ii regions is very satisfactory when accounting for diffusion and a minor chemical enrichment over the past 4.5 Gyr. \n",
      "586 Because of the generally lower temperatures encountered and the consequentially larger degree of dust condensation, the interstellar medium is a less reliable chemical composition gauge than H ii regions ( Jenkins 2004 ). \n",
      "587 Indeed, rather than setting constraints on the solar abundances, the Sun is often used to infer the amount in the solid phase in the interstellar medium (e.g., Sofia Meyer 2001 ). \n",
      "588 The local abundances of the volatile elements C ( Sofia et al. 2004 ), N ( Jensen, Rachford Snow 2007 ), and O ( Cartledge et al. 2006 ; Jensen, Rachford Snow 2005 ) in the interstellar medium support our recommended solar values in general. \n",
      "589 With the older, higher (log ε O = 8.83 − 8.93) solar abundances preferred by Grevesse Sauval (1998) and Anders Grevesse (1989) , it becomes very challenging to hide sufficient amounts of O in dust ( Jensen 2007 ). \n",
      "590 The gas phase abundances of the refractory elements is only a small fraction of the total abundance in both the cold and warm interstellar medium, preventing them from setting any stringent constraints. \n",
      "591 Also listed in Table 5 are predictions from models of Galactic chemical evolution ( Chiappini, Romano Matteucci 2003 ). \n",
      "592 Indeed, with these values it becomes difficult to reconcile the solar abundances with the results from OB stars and H ii regions for some elements like Fe. \n",
      "593 It is important to bear in mind though that the models have varying degrees of reliability for different elements. \n",
      "594 The evolutionary predictions for O, Ne, and Mg should be the most accurate, as they are produced in hydrostatic burning and ejected by SNe II; in fact for these elements there is good agreement between the Sun and its local neighborhood. \n",
      "595 All other elements are either produced in explosive burning and therefore dependent on the adopted mass-cut in the supernova explosion, or have a non-negligible contribution from SNe Ia or AGB stars, making theoretical estimates rather uncertain. \n",
      "596 One may conclude that the local Galactic volume has had a smaller star-formation rate than assumed in these chemical evolution models. \n",
      "597 This inference is borne out empirically by the observed age-metallicity relation, which Holmberg, Nordström Andersen (2008) estimated to be only 0.018 dex Gyr −1 for [Fe/H] in the Solar Neighborhood, that is, only half of the predictions in Table 5 . \n",
      "598 An alternative explanation would be recent Galactic infall of more pristine gas or Galactic orbital migration ( Schönrich Binney 2009 ). \n",
      "599 4.3. \n",
      "600 Helioseismology The situation is decidedly less encouraging when attempting to assess the solar abundances by means of helioseismology. \n",
      "601 Because the various solar oscillation p-modes penetrate to different depths, it is possible to map the variation of the sound speed in the solar interior, which can be compared to the predicted values from solar structure models (see Basu Antia 2008 , for a detailed review). \n",
      "602 With the Grevesse Sauval (1998) abundances, the predicted sound speed as a function of depth from standard solar models shows very good agreement with the helioseismic values. \n",
      "603 When instead employing the revised values of Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , this is no longer the case, a situation which has attracted a great deal of attention lately (e.g., Basu Antia 2004 , 2008 ; Turck-Chièze et al. 2004 ; Bahcall et al. 2005 ; Guzik, Watson Cox 2005 ; Delahaye Pinsonneault 2006 ). \n",
      "604 In this context it is perhaps fair to say that “better is worse.” \n",
      "605 The sound speed discrepancy most clearly shows up immediately below the bottom of the convection zone, as illustrated in Figure 8 . \n",
      "606 Also with the Grevesse Sauval (1998) abundances there was a disagreement in this region but it is greatly aggravated by the further lowering of the solar O and Ne abundances and, to a lesser extent, by the reassessment of C, N, and Fe. \n",
      "607 With the solar chemical composition recommended here ( Table 1 ), the situation is somewhat alleviated owing to the slightly higher abundances of these elements and consequently larger opacity in the radiative interior, but the deviation is still highly significant. \n",

      "610 Each model has independently been calibrated to achieve the correct solar luminosity, temperature, and age. \n",

      "614 Furthermore, the resulting He abundance when calibrating solar interior models to achieve the correct solar luminosity and temperature at the solar age is similarly inconsistent with the value inferred from helioseismology (see Section 3.9): Y S ≈ 0.238 compared to the observed 0.2485 ± 0.0034 ( Basu Antia 2004 ), where Y S is the present-day He mass fraction at the surface. \n",
      "615 The problem also persists in the solar core both as implied by low-degree p-modes ( Chaplin et al. 2007 ) and by gravity modes ( García et al. 2007 ). \n",
      "616 Thus, the problem exists in the convective envelope, in the radiative interior, and in the core. \n",
      "617 Following the initial revisions of the solar C and O abundances by Allende Prieto, Lambert Asplund (2001 , 2002) , many possible solutions have been put forward to explain the problem, albeit with little success to date. \n",
      "618 The most obvious explanation would be that the opacities are underestimated. \n",
      "619 Bahcall et al. (2005) estimated that a 10–20% increase of the OPAL opacities over a relatively substantial fraction of the solar interior ( R = 0.4–0.7 R ⊙ or equivalently T = 2–4 × 10 6 K) would be required; Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2009) found even slightly more stringent requirements with the Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) solar abundances. \n",
      "620 Serenelli et al. (in preparation) have investigated the differences with the solar chemical composition presented here and conclude that ≤12% extra opacity is required to restore the previous agreement in sound speed. \n",
      "621 Little suggests, however, that current atomic physics calculations for stellar interiors are missing such a substantial fraction of the opacity. \n",
      "622 For example, Badnell et al. (2005) showed that opacities from the Opacity Project are at most 3% larger than the corresponding OPAL values in the relevant temperature range. \n",
      "623 Although perhaps unlikely to cure the problem by itself, it is wise to bear in mind that a similar situation for pulsating stars in fact existed in the 1980s, which found an unexpected resolution with the more comprehensive calculations by the OPAL and OP collaborations. \n",
      "624 There are other ways to compensate for the lower opacities resulting from the lower C, N, O, and Ne abundances. \n",
      "625 One is that the radiative interior contains more metals than expected from the photospheric abundances and standard models for diffusion. \n",
      "626 Asplund et al. (2004) first suggested that the diffusion efficiency may be seriously underestimated but the required elemental settlement is about twice the predicted value. \n",
      "627 Furthermore, though this may remedy the sound speed discrepancy, problems still remain in terms of the He abundance and depth of the convection zone ( Montalbán et al. 2004 ; Guzik, Watson Cox 2005 ; Yang Bi 2007 ). \n",
      "628 A hypothetical late accretion of metal-depleted gas during the formation of the Sun runs into the same trouble ( Guzik, Watson Cox 2005 , Castro, Vauclair Richard 2007 ). \n",
      "629 Alternatively, the reduced O abundance could conceivably be compensated by a corresponding (but larger) increase in the Ne abundance ( Antia Basu 2005 ). \n",
      "630 Bahcall, Basu Serenelli (2005) estimated that a factor of three (0.5 dex) higher Ne content compared to the recommended values of Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , together with minor adjustments of C, N, O, and Ar within their associated uncertainties, would restore the good agreement found with the Grevesse Sauval (1998) solar composition. \n",
      "631 There was initial excitement when Drake Testa (2005) argued for exactly such an increase in Ne on the basis of inferences from coronal spectroscopy of other stars, but there is in fact little support for this idea, as explained in Section 3.9. \n",
      "632 The here recommended abundance of Ne is slightly higher than in Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , as are our recommended values for C, N, and O. This shift only partly allays the solar modeling discrepancy, as seen in Figure 8 . \n",
      "633 Given that the problem exceeds the likely uncertainties in existing input data (e.g., opacities, diffusion, abundances), the only remaining option on the solar interior side seems to be to invoke some physical process not yet accounted for in standard solar models. \n",
      "634 It is perhaps suggestive that the largest deviation occurs immediately below the convection zone. \n",
      "635 Arnett, Meakin Young (2005) have proposed that internal gravity waves generated by the convective motion at the base of the convection zone propagate inward and deposit their energy in the radiative zone. \n",
      "636 The ensuing structure changes are similar to an opacity enhancement, thus going in the right direction. \n",
      "637 In addition, the gravity waves induce additional mixing, which would also help. \n",
      "638 Young Arnett (2005) have investigated these processes using multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations of stellar convection zones and found qualitative improvements in many stellar regimes. \n",
      "639 Owing to the computationally very challenging nature of the hydrodynamics, the modeling is unfortunately not yet able to quantitatively predict whether the effects are sufficient to explain the helioseismic signature. \n",
      "640 Thus, most suggestions to resolve the solar modeling discrepancy have already been ruled out or are considered improbable. \n",
      "641 The few possibilities still standing do so largely because no detailed modeling has as yet been forthcoming to properly put the proposals to test. \n",
      "642 It is possible that a combination of several factors could be the explanation, but such fine tuning would seem rather contrived. \n",
      "643 Should no likely solution be found, it would suggest that the photospheric abundances presented herein are wrong. \n",
      "644 Given the discussion in Sections 2 and 3, it is not easy to understand where such a serious error may lie but the possibility should obviously not be discounted. \n",
      "645 4.4. \n",
      "646 Solar Neutrinos Neutrinos provide another means by which to infer the solar chemical composition, though current experiments are not yet sufficiently sensitive to return decisive results in this respect. \n",
      "647 The metallicity adopted in a solar model modifies the conditions in the core, and thus the neutrino fluxes produced by the pp-chain and CNO-cycle. \n",
      "648 Although the neutrino fluxes cannot be directly associated with abundances of individual elements, the relevant neutrino channels depend most sensitively on C, N, O, Si, and Fe ( Bahcall Serenelli 2005 ). \n",
      "649 Using neutrino data from the SuperKamiokande I+II, SNO, and Borexino experiments, Pena-Garay Serenelli (2008) have derived the neutrino oscillations and fluxes expected from solar models constructed with the Grevesse Sauval (1998) and Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) compositions. \n",
      "650 Intriguingly, the existing data imply 7 Be and 8 B neutrino fluxes that fall between the predictions for the two models; we suspect that the solar neutrinos would favor the new abundances presented herein. \n",
      "651 A more direct test of the heavily debated solar C, N, and O abundances would come from measuring the 13 N and 15 O β -decay neutrinos that follow proton capture on 12 C and 14 N, respectively. \n",
      "652 Meaningful constraints should come from Borexino within the next couple of years, and the proposed SNO+ experiment should weigh in with a definite answer sometime after 2011 ( Haxton Serenelli 2008 ). \n",
      "653 5. CONCLUDING REMARKS 5.1. \n",
      "654 Summary Points We have critically examined all ingredients for the determination of the solar photospheric chemical composition, from the atmospheric and line-formation modeling, required atomic data, and selection of lines to the final estimate of the elemental abundances and associated errors (Section 3). \n",
      "655 A notable feature of this analysis is that for essentially every element, the effects of 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres have now been accounted for. \n",
      "656 The 3D solar model employed here outperforms any 1D model, theoretical or semiempirical, in a raft of observational tests. \n",
      "657 The values we recommend for the most abundant metals C, N, O, Ne, and Fe are significantly smaller (by ∼0.2 dex) than those advocated in the widely used compilation of Anders Grevesse (1989) . \n",
      "658 Most of these differences can be attributed to the improvements over the past two decades in modeling the solar atmosphere, allowing for departures from LTE in the line formation, properly treating blends, and employing improved atomic and molecular data (Section 2). \n",
      "659 Among other things, these new, lower abundances are supported by the excellent agreement between different abundance indicators for C, N, and O: low-excitation forbidden atomic lines, high-excitation permitted atomic lines, and various molecular features. \n",
      "660 A comparison of the photospheric abundances and the most primitive class of meteorites, the CI chondrites, reveals a very good agreement for nearly all non-volatile elements (Section 4.1). \n",
      "661 Because the volatile elements, including H, have been depleted in the chondrites, the meteoritic abundance scale has been placed on the same absolute level as the photospheric abundances by enforcing equivalence of the Si abundances. \n",
      "662 The remaining few elements that suggest a significant difference between meteorites and the Sun can probably be attributed to poor solar determinations, likely owing to incorrect gf -values, unidentified blends, or unaccounted/wrong non-LTE effects. \n",
      "663 In order to make a meaningful comparison between the Sun and the abundances measured in the Solar Neighborhood, one must first correct for the effects of diffusion in the Sun and chemical enrichment in the Galaxy over the past 4.56 Gyr. \n",
      "664 All elements are predicted to have settled to the solar interior by essentially the same amount, meaning that the bulk, or equivalently the protosolar, composition is higher by 0.04 dex than listed in Table 1 for all elements heavier than He (Section 3.11). \n",
      "665 Our recommended solar abundances agree very well in general with those measured in nearby OB stars, H ii regions like Orion and the local interstellar medium (Section 4.2). \n",
      "666 We note that care should be exercised when comparing our solar results with corresponding abundances for late-type stars derived with classical 1D model atmospheres; ideally a differential study of the stars and the Sun should be performed; the solar abundances presented in Table 1 should be used to place them on an absolute scale. \n",
      "667 In spite of the many apparent successes of the solar chemical composition we recommend here, the outlook is not entirely rosy. \n",
      "668 With the downward revision of the overall metal content presented here compared to the Grevesse Sauval (1998) abundances, the previous excellent agreement between predicted sound speeds from standard solar models and those inferred from helioseismology is ruined (Section 4.3). \n",
      "669 To date, there has been no fully convincing solution put forward. \n",
      "670 The discordance has been alleviated somewhat relative to the recommended values in Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , but it nevertheless remains a significant discrepancy in urgent need of resolution. \n",
      "671 5.2. \n",
      "672 Future Issues Although major progress has been made in recent years in the inferred solar chemical composition, there is no question that a great deal of work remains before we can confidently state that each solar elemental abundance is known to better than 0.01 dex (2%). \n",
      "673 For many, if not most elements, the achieved accuracy today is more like 0.05 dex or indeed significantly worse in many cases. \n",
      "674 A concerted effort on multiple fronts is required to substantially decrease the remaining uncertainties. \n",
      "675 We do not consider it likely that subsequent generations of 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres will dramatically (that is, at the >0.1 dex level) amend the inferred solar photospheric chemical composition, given how successful the most recent models are in reproducing key observational diagnostics. \n",
      "676 It is fair to say that the mean temperature structure of the quiet solar granulation, the velocity distribution, and the atmospheric inhomogeneities are now rather well known, at least in the formation regions of the weaker lines largely employed by the abundance studies described herein. \n",
      "677 Higher atmospheric layers, to which the strongest atomic and molecular lines are more sensitive, are naturally less constrained observationally; on the modeling side this requires improved radiative transfer treatment and allowance of departures from LTE for key elements. \n",
      "678 For completeness, one should include the effects of magnetic fields in the 3D solar atmospheric models, but we do not expect that these will noticeably influence the derived abundances ( Nordlund, Stein Asplund 2009 ). \n",
      "679 The greatest uncertainties afflicting solar abundance work today instead stem from poor atomic and molecular data, as well as incomplete modeling of departures from LTE. \n",
      "680 Few spectral lines have their transition probabilities determined to better than a few percent. \n",
      "681 As an example here, it suffices to mention the case of Mg with its relatively simple atomic structure: The majority of the Mg i lines employed here and elsewhere for solar abundance purposes still have quoted uncertainties of 25–50% according to the NIST database, which is clearly unacceptable. \n",
      "682 Fortunately, there has been some laudable progress on this score in recent years, in terms of both experimental efforts (e.g., Johansson et al. 2003 , Blackwell-Whitehead Bergemann 2007 , Lawler et al. 2009 ) and theoretical calculations (e.g., Kurucz 1992 , Plez 1998 , Badnell et al. 2005 ), as discussed in Section 2.2. \n",
      "683 A major problem, however, is the dearth of atomic physicists devoted to satisfying the astronomical need for various types of input data; the astronomical community ought to better appreciate and encourage the relatively few individuals carrying out this important work, given its tremendous benefit for solar and stellar astrophysics especially. \n",
      "684 On the wish list are improved gf -values for Mg i , Mg ii , Si ii , Ca ii , the once-ionized species of the Fe-peak elements, Cu i , and Sr ii . \n",
      "685 Also, atomic lines in the IR have great potential given the accurate determination of the continuum and few blends but more often than not accurate transition probabilities are lacking. \n",
      "686 Equally important is the consideration of non-LTE effects on line formation. \n",
      "687 As discussed by Asplund (2005) , even though departures from LTE are expected to be relatively serene in the Sun, one should always expect non-LTE abundance corrections at around the 0.05 dex level; indeed in many cases the effects will be significantly more severe. \n",
      "688 Still today, most elements have not been exposed to a detailed non-LTE study even in the Sun. \n",
      "689 Even rarer are solar abundance works going beyond the 1D framework and employing 3D non-LTE calculations (e.g., Asplund, Carlsson Botnen 2003 ; Asplund et al. 2004 ). \n",
      "690 In part, the scarcity of non-LTE studies is related to a lack of adequate atomic data. \n",
      "691 Compared to the LTE case, vastly more input data are required in non-LTE calculations than are presently available for most elements. \n",
      "692 Significant headway will only become possible with the advent of detailed photoionization and collisional cross sections; for the latter, estimates of the impact of both electron and H collisions, as well as other processes like charge transfer, are urgently needed. \n",
      "693 There is also an issue of manpower; careful non-LTE studies are very time-consuming and there are not enough specialists working in the field to satisfy the demand. \n",
      "694 Finally, we note that non-LTE line formation should be explored in 3D model atmospheres, because the presence of atmospheric inhomogeneities is generally expected to amplify any existing non-LTE effects seen in 1D. \n",
      "695 A section on future issues in the solar chemical composition would not be complete without stressing the importance of finally resolving the solar modeling problem uncovered by helioseismology (Section 4.3). \n",
      "696 Many hypotheses have been put forward to explain the discrepancy, but no clear solution has been forthcoming. \n",
      "697 Until an explanation has been found, a mutual cloud of doubt will always linger over the solar chemical composition recommended here and current models of the solar interior. \n",
      "698 Whether the problem will be traced in the end to shortcomings in the atmospheric or interior modeling remains to be seen, but whatever the resolution it will place solar and stellar astrophysics—and, by extension, most of astronomy—on a much firmer footing.\n"
