      "1: The chemical evolution of galaxies is a complex interplay between stellar nucleosynthesis, galactic outflows, and the mixing of material within the galaxy. In this paper, we focus on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, specifically examining how oxygen abundance ([O/Fe]) evolves over time due to these processes. The data presented in Figure 9 shows a bimodal distribution of [O/Fe], which suggests two distinct populations contributing to the overall chemical evolution. To understand this phenomenon, we developed an analytic model that considers the production and decay of heavy elements like oxygen through stellar nucleosynthesis and galactic winds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our model assumes that star formation begins at time t=0 and follows a specific star formation rate (SFR) curve for 5 billion years. The SFR is modeled such that it peaks at a certain point, after which it declines gradually. This assumption aligns with the idea that galaxies experience periods of rapid star formation followed by quiescence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The production of oxygen and other heavy elements through Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) is a critical component of our model. We assume that the rate of Fe production follows a specific function, while the production of α-elements (like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen) occurs at a different rate due to delays in their nucleosynthetic pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Equation (5) describes the iron mass as a function of time, integrating the supernova rates. Similarly, Equation (6) models the accumulation of α-elements over time, considering the delay timescale τ. The initial and asymptotic values of these elements are crucial in shaping the bimodal distribution observed in [O/Fe].\n",
      "\n",
      "By setting specific parameters such as τ = 0.15 Gyr for white dwarf formation and accretion timescales, our model predicts that oxygen abundance reaches a peak at around 8 Gyr after star formation begins. This peak corresponds to the time when the first generation of stars (Population I) have contributed their heavy elements to the interstellar medium, which are then incorporated into subsequent generations of stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "After this initial peak, the second generation of stars (Population II), formed from the same stellar population but after Population I has dispersed or evolved away, contribute additional oxygen. This dual contribution leads to the observed bimodal distribution in [O/Fe], with two distinct peaks corresponding to the contributions from each population.\n",
      "\n",
      "The model also accounts for the gradual decline in oxygen abundance as later generations of stars produce fewer heavy elements due to the declining star formation rate and the subsequent outflow of material from the galaxy. This decline is further modulated by the mixing processes within the galaxy, which homogenize the chemical abundances over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, our analytic model successfully captures the key features of the [O/Fe] distribution observed in Figure 9, providing valuable insights into the multi-step nature of heavy element production and their contributions to galactic chemical evolution.\n"
