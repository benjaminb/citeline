      "Okay, so I need to figure out the original contributions of this research paper about the morphology of extragalactic radio sources in terms of their high and low luminosity. The user has provided a detailed abstract and references, but they want me to identify the key contributions as JSON objects.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I'll read through the abstract carefully. It mentions that there's a correlation between the relative positions of high and low brightness regions in radio sources and their luminosity. They used the 3CR sample, which is a well-known dataset for radio galaxies. The authors classified these sources into two classes based on the ratio of distances between high and low brightness regions compared to the total extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should note that they specifically analyzed sources with adequate resolution, excluding those where it was impossible or where classification wasn't feasible. This methodological approach seems like a significant contribution because it provides a clear criterion for classifying these sources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the results in Table I, there's a clear division in luminosity between class I and II sources. The dividing line is around 3×10^25 W Hz^-1 sr^-1. This finding suggests that higher luminosity sources have different morphological structures compared to lower ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another point is their discussion on the implications of these classifications. They mention that low brightness regions in class I are further from the galaxy, while high brightness regions are closer. This spatial relationship could indicate how energy is transported and deposited within the source.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also compare the properties of high and low brightness regions across classes, noting similarities in energy densities and spectral indices. This suggests that despite differences in structure, both regions contribute similarly to the overall radio emission.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors highlight that their findings support the idea that reprocessed relativistic particles are involved, with different timescales for energy equipartition depending on whether it's a high or low brightness region. This insight could be crucial for understanding the mechanisms behind radio galaxy evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, they acknowledge that class II sources don't necessarily move them from one class to another if low brightness regions exist, which adds nuance to their classification system.\n",
