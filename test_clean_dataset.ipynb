      "Subsequently,  selected a wide binary candidate sample from TGAS with an emphasis on purity, using a Bayesian method to calculate the probability that a given pair of stars is gravitationally bound.\n",
      " investigated how the separation of their candidate pairs varied with distance and astrometric uncertainties.\n",
      "This led  to conclude that most of the pairs with separations 1 0 5 au reported in other works were chance alignments, not gravitationally bound binaries.\n",
      "It may also owe in part to the mass ratio distribution adopted in population synthesis models, which is more top-heavy than observed (e.g.  ).\n",
      " used a related method to study the eccentricity distribution of a larger sample of 1 0 5 wide binaries within 200 pc from Gaia DR3.\n",
      " inferred an eccentricity distribution consistent with uniform at separations of 100 au , and steadily increasing eccentricities over 100 1000 au ( Fig. 3 , bottom right).\n",
      "3.1.5 The mass ratio distribution and twin binaries The homogeneity and well-understood selection function of the Gaia data allowed  to infer the intrinsic mass ratio distribution of wide binaries as a function of primary mass and separation.\n",
      " showed that the eccentricities of the wide twins are on average higher than those of non-twins with similar separations.\n",
      " attempted to constrain the separation below which metallicity dependence appears using a sample of wide binaries from Gaia DR2 and metallicities from several wide-field surveys.\n",
      " and  focused on wide binaries ( 1000 au) and found more complicated behavior than the flat trend with metallicity reported by  : they found that the wide binary fraction peaks at [ Fe/H ] = 0 and declines towards both higher and lower metallicities.\n",
      "Curiously, comparison of their sample and the sample used by  suggested that the discrepant results are in large part due to different treatments of hierarchical triples:  employed cuts on relative proper motion that excluded most triples, while  included them, and the triples seem to cluster at [ Fe/H ] = 0 .\n",
      "Triples can thus be identified as wide binaries in which the apparent velocity difference between the two resolved components is larger than expected for a bound orbit, but still smaller than expected for chance alignments (e.g.  ).\n",
      "In his now-seminal study using adaptive optics imaging of nearby spectroscopic binaries,  found that 96 7 % of solar-type binaries with P 3 d have a wide companion.\n",
      "3.3 Tests of gravity Binaries with separations larger than 1 0 4 au have sufficiently low internal accelerations that they are in the so-called deep MOND regime: that is, the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND;  ) theory of gravity predicts measurably different orbital velocities from general relativity.\n",
      "Projection effects tend to increase the apparent velocity difference of wide binaries (  ).\n",
      "In another study,  found Newtonian gravity to be strongly preferred ( 16 ) over MOND, with relatively weak sensitivity to the assumed eccentricity distribution and parameters of the inner binary population.\n",
      " showed that selecting targets with large ruwe (e.g. ruwe > 1 . 4 ) yields a sample of sources preferentially in regions of the color-magnitude diagram where binaries are expected to be concentrated ( Fig. 5 , right panel).\n",
      "For binaries with orbital periods shorter than the Gaia observational baseline, the expected amplitude of the ruwe signal due to an unresolved binary scales approximately linearly with the angular size of the photocenter orbit (e.g.  ).\n",
      " studied the ruwe distributions of nearby white dwarfs and found evidence for a dearth of WD+WD binaries with au-scale orbits (i.e., the separation range to which ruwe is most sensitive), presumably because most orbits in this separation range are cleared out by common envelope evolution.\n",
      "The gravitational effects of the directly-imaged planet Pic b on its host star, for example, were detected by  with high significance.\n",
      "The right panel of Fig. 7 shows how q depends on the mass ratio for typical main-sequence stars: using a 300-Myr old MIST isochrone with solar metallicity (  ), I plot the predicted a 0 for a Sun-like star with a range of main-sequence companions.\n",
      "Acceleration solutions may eventually become powerful for identifying stellar- or even intermediate-mass black holes from partial orbits (  ).\n",
      " made the first attempt to incorporate binary evolution via population synthesis simulations in predictions for the Gaia BH population.\n",
      "5.1.3 Planets and brown dwarfs Gaia has been predicted to eventually discover between 1 0 4 and 1 0 5 exoplanets via astrometric wobble of their host stars (  ).\n",
      " showed that the widest astrometric binaries, with separations 30 mas , can be resolved with GRAVITY interferometry.\n",
      " showed that the rate of spurious orbital solutions among the spectroscopic orbital solutions is generally highest at short periods; they designed a quality metric to filter out spurious solutions that combines information contained in several different Gaia quality flags.\n",
      " used this fact to select a sample of 6000 candidate ellipsoidal variables that may host a compact object companion, including 262 high-confidence systems with minimum mass ratios significantly larger than one.\n",
      " investigated the nature of this sample in more detail, carrying out spectroscopic follow-up on a sub-sample of the candidates.\n",
      " assembled a nearly-complete sample of 42 cataclysmic variables within 150 pc (bottom panel of Fig. 12 ), from which they measured a CV space density of = 4 .\n",
      " found that magnetic CVs (polars and intermediate polars) make up 36% of the 150 pc sample a much larger fraction than in earlier CV samples that were not volume limited.\n",
      "Linking them to triples (if they have tertiary companions, as e.g.  find most close binaries do) implies that original inner periods in those triples were of a few days.\n",
      "6.4 Hypervelocity white dwarfs By using Gaia astrometry to search for stars with high proper motions and large distances,  identified a population of hypervelocity stars launched from thermonuclear supernovae in close WD binaries.\n",
      "The flight path of the youngest such star identified by  can be traced back to a type Ia supernova remnant ( Fig. 13 , left panel), in strong support of this formation model.\n",
      " propose that the slower of these objects (LP 40-365 stars) are partially burned runaway accretors from single-degenerate thermonuclear supernovae, while the higher-velocity objects are runaway donors from double-degenerate binaries.\n",
      "These data will foreseeable yield good constraints on the orbits of binaries with periods reaching up to 20 years, and useful acceleration constraints at even longer periods (e.g.  ).\n",
      "We note that  adopted a somewhat larger correction, 0.074 dex, than that of  .\n",
      "In other words, the solar metallicity is no longer the canonical 2% recommended by  but rather a substantially smaller 1.4%.\n",
      "Our metallicity reverses this declining trend of Z with time by being slightly larger than advocated by  , which is mainly the result of the somewhat higher C, N, O, Ne, and Fe abundances.\n",
      "Finally, from Table 4 it is clear that the surface He abundance employed by  is too low on account of adopting a too efficient elemental diffusion.\n",
      "The most primitive, undifferentiated meteorites in this respect are the so-called C I (or C1) carbonaceous chondrites, of which only five are known: the Alais, Ivuna (after which this class of meteorites is named), Orgueil, Revelstoke, and Tonk meteorites (  ).\n",
      "We note a significant improvement for W compared to previous compilations of the solar chemical composition [Δlog ε = +0.49 dex in  , whereas here the difference amounts to +0.20 dex]; we suspect that unidentified blends and/or erroneous continuum placement may be at fault for the persisting discrepancy, likewise for Rb and Hf.\n",
      "The remaining three elements, Rh, Ag, and Pb, have had their photospheric values determined from transitions originating either in the ground state or from low-excitation levels of the neutral species (also true for Pd, W, and Au), which are prone to non-LTE effects in their excitation and ionization populations (  ).\n",
      "It is unclear whether the solution can be found in the solar or B star analyses or, if a real difference indeed exists, perhaps due to infall of low-metallicity gas to the Solar Neighborhood or due to Galactic orbital migration (  ).\n",
      "In Table 5 we provide the values from  and  interpolated to a Galacto-centric radius of 8 kpc.\n",
      "For C and O this somewhat uncertain dust correction amounts to ≈0.1 dex in Orion (  ).\n",
      "Because of the generally lower temperatures encountered and the consequentially larger degree of dust condensation, the interstellar medium is a less reliable chemical composition gauge than H ii regions (  ).\n",
      "Indeed, rather than setting constraints on the solar abundances, the Sun is often used to infer the amount in the solid phase in the interstellar medium (e.g.,  ).\n",
      "Also listed in Table 5 are predictions from models of Galactic chemical evolution (  ).\n",
      "An alternative explanation would be recent Galactic infall of more pristine gas or Galactic orbital migration (  ).\n",
      "The inferred depth of the convection zone is now too shallow: R BCZ ≈ 0.725 R ⊙ instead of the helioseismic measurement 0.7133 ± 0.0005 R ⊙ (  ).\n",
      "Furthermore, the resulting He abundance when calibrating solar interior models to achieve the correct solar luminosity and temperature at the solar age is similarly inconsistent with the value inferred from helioseismology (see Section 3.9): Y S ≈ 0.238 compared to the observed 0.2485 ± 0.0034 (  ), where Y S is the present-day He mass fraction at the surface.\n"
