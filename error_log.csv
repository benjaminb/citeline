    "Developed a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging to remove aperture bias in star formation rate (SFR) estimates, enabling accurate total SFR calculations in galaxies.",
    "Determined the SFR density to be 1.915^{+0.02}_{-0.01} (random)^{+0.14}_{-0.42} (systematic) h_{70}10^{-2} M_{\odot} yr^{-1} Mpc^{-3} at z=0.1 for a Kroupa initial mass function.",
    "Found that the majority of star formation in the low-redshift Universe occurs in moderately massive galaxies (10^{10}-10^{11} M_{\odot}), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies.",
    "Approximately 15% of all star formation takes place in galaxies showing signs of an active nucleus, and about 20% occurs in starburst galaxies.",
    "Showed that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M_{*} > 10^{10} M_{\odot}.",
    "The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408^{+0.005}_{-0.002} (random)^{+0.029}_{-0.090}h^{-1}_{70}, used to constrain the star formation history of the Universe.",
    "For the concordance cosmology, the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate, corresponding to a time-scale of 7^{+0.7}_{-1.5} Gyr for an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history.",
    "Found a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-Ã… break (D4000) and b, suggesting D4000 can estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies."
