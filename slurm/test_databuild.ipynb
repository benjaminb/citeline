      "Sentence 2: Millennia after their discovery (e.g. Jetsu and Porceddu, 2015 ), binaries remain at the heart of many of the interesting open questions in astrophysics: binary evolution modeling is key for understanding the origin of gravitational wave events, the spectral energy distributions of high redshift galaxies, and the demographics of exoplanets in the solar neighborhood.\n",
      "Sentence 3: Astrometry has played a particularly important role for binary star astronomy.\n",
      "Sentence 4: Painstaking measurements of the relative positions of two stars in resolved optical pairs over the course of decades allowed Herschel (1803) to infer that most of the pairs he studied were orbiting one another.\n",
      "Sentence 5: By monitoring the motion of Sirius and Procyon over a century, Bessel (1844) realized that, despite having no visible companions, these stars did not move in straight lines.\n",
      "Sentence 6: He correctly deduced that the stars special motions were the result of the gravity of massive unseen companions, now known to be white dwarfs.\n",
      "Sentence 7: The Gaia mission ( Prusti et al., 2016; Brown et al., 2018; Arenou et al., 2023 ) brought astrometry to the masses.\n",
      "Sentence 8: Gaia has revolutionized the study of binary stars and indeed, of all stars by delivering precise and accurate distance and proper motion measurements for hundreds of millions of sources in the Milky Way.\n",
      "Sentence 9: Gaias promise for binary population demographics and the discovery of rare objects was recognized well before launch (e.g. Perryman et al., 2001; Sderhjelm, 2004; Fuchs and Bastian, 2005 ).\n",
      "Sentence 10: The mission builds on the legacy of Hipparcos ( Perryman et al., 1997; ESA, 1997 ) which allowed for discovery and characterization of binaries in the solar neighborhood ( Sderhjelm, 1999 ) but Gaia looks 100 times deeper into the Galaxy than Hipparcos did, opening up a discovery space 1 0 6 times larger.\n",
      "Sentence 11: This review summarizes major developments in binary star astrophysics that have been enabled by Gaia , and the state of the field as of early 2024.\n",
      "Sentence 12: I will neither attempt to cover the full history of the field (which is long, and mostly predates Gaia ) nor provide a comprehensive list of results.\n",
      "Sentence 13: Instead, I will attempt to highlight the most significant new findings and open questions, some of which will likely be answered by the Gaia data in the coming years, and to provide references for interested readers to dig deeper.\n",
      "Sentence 14: For a broader perspective, I refer to previous reviews by Abt (1983) , Duchne and Kraus (2013) , Moe and Di Stefano (2017) , Offner et al. (2023) , and Chen et al. (2024) .\n",
      "Sentence 15: None of the work discussed here would be possible without an enormous investment of time and resources by the Gaia data processing and analysis consortium (DPAC) to provide a well-documented, high-quality data product.\n",
      "Sentence 16: The community owes DPAC!\n",
      "Sentence 17: 2 A many-pronged approach to the binary census Binaries exist over an enormous range of physical scales.\n",
      "Sentence 18: They are observed in the Milky Way with orbital periods ranging from 5 min ( Roelofs et al., 2010; Burdge et al., 2020 ) to 100 Myr ( Eggleton et al., 1989; El-Badry et al., 2021 ) a dynamical range 1 0 9 in separation and 1 0 13 in period.\n",
      "Sentence 19: Their mass ratios range from 1 0 6 (planets) to 1 0 2 (black holes).\n",
      "Sentence 20: A battery of different observational techniques is required to study binaries across this parameter space.\n",
      "Sentence 21: Gaia is sensitive to essentially all possible separations, but the effective survey volume varies enormously with separation ( Fig. 1 ).\n",
      "Sentence 22: Gaia is a survey mission, whose goal is to collect a relatively small amount of data for a large number of sources.\n",
      "Sentence 23: This makes Gaia well-suited for tasks such as constructing large samples, identifying rare objects, and characterizing subtle features in binary population demographics.\n",
      "Sentence 24: There are also questions that can be better answered by datasets predating Gaia .\n",
      "Sentence 25: For example, studies of the absolute binary fraction and period distribution are best carried out with samples with high completeness, which require long observational baselines and a diversity of observation techniques (e.g. Duquennoy and Mayor, 1991; Raghavan et al., 2010 ).\n",
      "Sentence 26: Studies of eclipsing and ellipsoidal binaries benefit from a large number of photometric epochs, which can currently best be provided by ground-based surveys such as OGLE ( Soszyski et al., 2016 ), ASAS-SN ( Rowan et al., 2022; Li et al., 2024 ), and ZTF ( Chen et al., 2020 ).\n",
      "Sentence 27: Gaias greatest strength relative to other missions is astrometry.\n",
      "Sentence 28: Even for binary populations best identified with other methods, astrometric distance constraints from Gaia have been critical for defining samples and measuring physical parameters (see Section 6 ).\n",
      "Sentence 29: We now turn to Gaias impact on binary studies across the parameter space shown in Fig. 1 .\n",
      "Sentence 30: 3 Spatially resolved binaries The widest binaries can be spatially resolved by Gaia , with single-star astrometric solutions produced for both components.\n",
      "Sentence 31: Gaia s effective angular resolution of 1 arcsec (a more precise value will be inferred below) corresponds to a minimum projected physical separation for a binary at a distance d .\n",
      "Sentence 32: Given that stars expand to maximum dimensions of order 10 au during their evolution, essentially all the binaries Gaia can resolve are effectively single; i.e., no mass transfer between the stars is expected, and their evolution should not be altered by the presence of the companion.\n",
      "Sentence 33: Such wide companions are relatively common: companions with separations s 100 au are found around more than 10% of solar-type stars (e.g. Smart et al., 2021 ).\n",
      "Sentence 34: Fig. 2 quantifies the angular resolution and contrast sensitivity of Gaia DR3.\n",

      "Sentence 36: 4 (indicative of an unproblematic astrometric solution; Section 4 ), the 3rd panel showing sources with a published bp_rp color, and the 4th sources with colors passing the quality cuts on phot_bp_rp_excess_factor described by Riello et al. (2021) .\n",
      "Sentence 37: In all panels, the sensitivity is relative to the sensitivity at asymptotically wide separations, calculated from the two-point correlation function of chance alignments following El-Badry and Rix (2018) .\n",
      "Sentence 38: For near equal-brightness pairs with no quality cuts, the completeness drops to 50% at 0 .\n",
      "Sentence 39: 6 arcsec, and to 0 at 0.3 arcsec.\n",
      "Sentence 40: The requirement of a good bp_rp color results in significantly poorer sensitivity to close companions, since the fluxes in the BP and RP bands are dispersed over a 2 3 arcsec window and thus are quite vulnerable to blending by a companion (e.g. Evans et al., 2018 ).\n",
      "Sentence 41: This means, for example, that white dwarf companions to main sequence stars are only detectable at relatively wide separations.\n",
      "Sentence 42: Although Gaia currently resolves very few binaries with separations below 0.5 arcsec, the telescopes 0 .\n",
      "Sentence 43: 1 arcsec diffraction limit will ultimately allow closer pairs to be resolved.\n",
      "Sentence 44: For example, Hipparcos resolved pairs with separations as small as 0.1 arcsec, about 3 times smaller than its diffraction limit ( Lindegren et al., 1997 ).\n",
      "Sentence 45: Specialized processing of astrometry for binaries would be required to achieve comparable results with Gaia .\n",
      "Sentence 46: By the end of the mission, Gaia is expected to resolve equal-brightness binaries down to separations of 0.1 arcsec ( Harrison et al., 2023 ), although it may not derive robust astrometric solutions for both components.\n",
      "Sentence 47: 3.1 Population demographics Population demographics of wide binaries i.e., their distributions of orbital separation, mass ratio, eccentricity, metallicity, etc., are of interest as an observable outcome of the star formation process that can be compared to models of star and binary formation (e.g. Bate and Bonnell, 1997; Bate, 2009; Marks and Kroupa, 2012; Bate, 2019; Rozner and Perets, 2023; Guszejnov et al., 2023 ).\n",
      "Sentence 48: Before Gaia , it was difficult to distinguish physically associated binaries from random chance alignments.\n",

      "Sentence 50: Only for very wide separations ( s 50 , 000 au), larger distances, and fainter stars, does ambiguity remain common.\n",

      "Sentence 54: Oelkers et al. (2017) found a bimodal separation distribution separated by a valley at 0 .\n",
      "Sentence 55: 1 pc.\n",
      "Sentence 56: Similar separation distributions had been found in some earlier samples (e.g. Dhital et al., 2010 ) and were interpreted as evidence of different formation processes for binaries with a 1 0 4 au (e.g. Kouwenhoven et al., 2010 ).\n",
      "Sentence 57: Oh et al. (2017) found a separation distribution that increased monotonically toward wider separations and interpreted the wider pairs as moving groups; i.e., associations of stars that formed together and are still slowly drifting apart, despite no longer being gravitationally bound (see also Shaya and Olling, 2011 , who reported similar results based on Hipparcos data).\n",
      "Sentence 58: Subsequently, Andrews et al. (2017) selected a wide binary candidate sample from TGAS with an emphasis on purity, using a Bayesian method to calculate the probability that a given pair of stars is gravitationally bound.\n",
      "Sentence 59: They demonstrated that the Gaia data are sufficiently precise that orbital motion within wide binaries is often detectable, even at separations of thousands of au.\n",
      "Sentence 60: This means that it is generally not a good assumption that the space velocities and/or proper motions of wide binary components should be consistent within their uncertainties.\n",
      "Sentence 61: Andrews et al. (2017) investigated how the separation of their candidate pairs varied with distance and astrometric uncertainties.\n",
      "Sentence 62: Their selection also yielded a bimodal separation distribution when they employed less stringent cuts on distance and astrometric uncertainty.\n",
      "Sentence 63: However, the relative normalization of the wide peak declined at closer distances from the Sun and essentially vanished when the strictest cuts on parallax and proper motion uncertainties were used.\n",
      "Sentence 64: This led Andrews et al. (2017) to conclude that most of the pairs with separations 1 0 5 au reported in other works were chance alignments, not gravitationally bound binaries.\n",
      "Sentence 65: Their analysis showed that the population statistics of the wide peak are consistent with what is expected for chance alignments (see e.g., the upper left panel of Fig. 3 ).\n",
      "Sentence 66: It is possible that some unbound pairs are physically associated groups of stars that formed together and are drifting apart.\n",
      "Sentence 67: However, such groups are expected to be short lived: for a typical velocity dispersion of 1 km s 1 , a pair of initially co-located stars will reach a separation 1 pc within 1 Myr.\n",
      "Sentence 68: Dissolving star clusters may yield pairs with separations of 10100 pc (moving groups), but pairs with projected separations of 1 pc can be rather cleanly separated into bound binaries and chance alignments.\n",
      "Sentence 69: The division between the two groups becomes increasingly clear as the data quality improves.\n",
      "Sentence 70: Gaia DR2 and DR3 provided significantly improved astrometric data quality, and several groups used the data to construct samples of wide binaries ( El-Badry and Rix, 2018; Jimnez-Esteban et al., 2019; Hartman and Lpine, 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Hwang et al., 2021; El-Badry et al., 2021 ).\n",
      "Sentence 71: None of these works found evidence for a bimodal separation distribution, instead finding that the separation distribution declines as d N / d s s at wide separations, with 1 .\n",

      "Sentence 74: 3.1.2 Wide white dwarf binaries About 16,000 resolved white dwarf (WD) + main sequence (MS) binaries, and 1500 WD+WD wide binaries have been identified from Gaia data ( El-Badry et al., 2021; Heintz et al., 2022 ).\n",
      "Sentence 75: One resolved WD+WD+WD triple has also been identified ( Perpiny-Valls et al., 2019 ).\n",
      "Sentence 76: Because the ages of WDs can typically be measured with higher precision than the ages of MS stars, wide binaries containing a white dwarf provide an opportunity to age-date the companion, under the assumption that the two stars are coeval (e.g. Fouesneau et al., 2019; Qiu et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2021; Moss et al., 2022 ).\n",
      "Sentence 77: The same assumption allowed Hollands et al. (2024) to constrain the initialfinal mass relation for WDs by modeling a large sample of resolved WD+WD binaries for which they obtained follow-up spectroscopy.\n",
      "Sentence 78: Heintz et al. (2022) tested the robustness of WD age constraints by comparing the independently-measured ages of individual WDs in WD+WD binaries.\n",
      "Sentence 79: They found generally satisfactory agreement for a majority of systems, with typical uncertainties of order 25%.\n",
      "Sentence 80: However, they found that 21%36% of binaries in their sample contain a more massive WD with a shorter cooling age than its less massive companion, which is not expected if the components are coeval and the initialfinal mass relation is monotonic.\n",
      "Sentence 81: They attributed these discrepant ages mainly to triple evolution, wherein a merger of an inner binary can produce a massive white dwarf with a long pre-WD lifetime.\n",
      "Sentence 82: El-Badry and Rix (2018) reported that the separation distribution of WD + MS and WD + WD binaries from Gaia DR2 drops off more steeply at wide separations ( s 3 , 000 au) than the separation distribution of MS binaries from which these systems form.\n",
      "Sentence 83: They conjectured that this is a result of impulsive or asymmetric mass loss during the AGB phase, which could impart weak ( 0 . 75 km s 1 ) kicks on the nascent WDs and unbind the widest binaries.\n",
      "Sentence 84: Torres et al. (2022) found a similar but weaker break in the separation distribution from Gaia DR3, and Shariat et al. (2023) found that kicks were required to explain the observed separation distribution of Gaia WD triples.\n",
      "Sentence 85: The physical mechanism that may produce these kicks is uncertain.\n",
      "Sentence 86: OBrien et al. (2024) constructed a nearly complete Gaia sample of WDs within 40 pc.\n",
      "Sentence 87: The sample contains 97 resolved WD+MS binaries, and 15 resolved WD+WD binaries.\n",
      "Sentence 88: The number of WD+WD binaries is at least a factor of 10 lower than predicted by binary population synthesis models ( Toonen et al., 2017 ).\n",
      "Sentence 89: This mismatch could be partially explained by WD kicks, which would unbind many would-be WD+WD binaries.\n",
      "Sentence 90: It may also owe in part to the mass ratio distribution adopted in population synthesis models, which is more top-heavy than observed (e.g. El-Badry et al., 2019 ).\n",
      "Sentence 91: Noor et al. (2024) found that the wide binary fraction of polluted DAZ WDs is similar to that of normal field WDs, suggesting that WD pollution is driven mainly by planets and is not driven primarily by binary companions, as had been proposed ( Bonsor and Veras, 2015 ).\n",
      "Sentence 92: Curiously, they found that DZ WDs (polluted WDs with helium-dominated atmospheres) have a wide binary fraction at least 3 times lower than DAZ or normal field WDs.\n",
      "Sentence 93: Such a difference is not expected in the standard evolutionary scenarios invoked for WD pollution and spectral type evolution.\n",
      "Sentence 94: 3.1.3 The separation distribution across galactic populations and constraints on perturbers Tian et al. (2020) explored how the separation distribution of wide binaries varies across Galactic stellar populations.\n",
      "Sentence 95: It has long been appreciated that wide binaries are fragile and can be disrupted by encounters with other massive objects (e.g. Bahcall et al., 1985; Yoo et al., 2004; Ramirez and Buckley, 2023 ), making their separation distribution a sensitive probe of the Galactic tidal field and of small-scale structure in the gravitational potential.\n",
      "Sentence 96: One might therefore expect that the separation distribution of binaries in the disk which suffer frequent interactions with passing stars, molecular clouds, compact objects, etc., would fall off more steeply toward wide separations than that of binaries in the Galactic halo.\n",
      "Sentence 97: Tian et al. (2020) tested this hypothesis using wide binaries from Gaia DR2.\n",
      "Sentence 98: They found that kinematically selected samples of binaries on halo-like and disk-like orbits have essentially identical intrinsic separation distributions out to separations of at least 1 0 4 au.\n",
      "Sentence 99: At the widest separations, they found modest evidence for a steeper decline in the separation distribution of halo binaries than in that of disk binaries, contrary to the trend that might be expected due to disruption of wide binaries by dynamical encounters.\n",
      "Sentence 100: Tian et al. (2020) speculated that this might reflect the different star formation conditions from which the halo and disk binaries were born.\n",
      "Sentence 101: In any case, this work showed that if precise measurements of dynamical perturbations are sought from wide binaries, then the initial separation distribution of wide binaries is a dominant source of uncertainty.\n",
      "Sentence 102: 3.1.4 Eccentricities Essentially all binaries that are spatially resolved by Gaia have orbital periods that are much too long for significant orbital motion to be observed on a timescale of a few years.\n",
      "Sentence 103: This makes eccentricity measurements for individual wide binaries impossible.\n",
      "Sentence 104: However, the distribution of wide binary eccentricities can still be studied from the distribution of the relative proper motions of the components (both speed and direction), which probe the orbital velocity at a particular snapshot in time.\n",
      "Sentence 105: A few approaches have been used to exploit this.\n",
      "Sentence 106: Using Monte Carlo simulations, Tokovinin (2020) applied the method developed by Tokovinin and Kiyaeva (2016) to a sample of 2600 binaries from Gaia DR2 within 67 pc of the Sun.\n",
      "Sentence 107: This approach forward-models the distribution of the angle, , between a binarys position angle and relative velocity vector, and the amplitude of the projected orbital speed normalized by separation and the binarys total mass.\n",
      "Sentence 108: Limiting his analysis to low-mass binaries ( M 1 1 M ) and attempting to remove higher-order multiples, he found that the eccentricity distribution of the full sample was close to thermal ( f ( e ) d e = 2 e d e , corresponding to a median eccentricity of about 0.71).\n",
      "Sentence 109: He also found a relative dearth of highly eccentric binaries at separations less than 200 au (a sub-thermal distribution, but still more eccentric than a uniform distribution), and a slightly super-thermal distribution at separations wider than 1000 au.\n",
      "Sentence 110: Hwang et al. (2022c) used a related method to study the eccentricity distribution of a larger sample of 1 0 5 wide binaries within 200 pc from Gaia DR3.\n",
      "Sentence 111: Using the method originally developed by Tokovinin (1998) which depends only on the distribution of the angle and not on the magnitude of the orbital speed they inferred the eccentricity distribution as a function of separation.\n",
      "Sentence 112: Assuming binaries are randomly oriented and observed at random phases, one expects circular orbits to preferentially be observed with = 90 deg (perpendicular position and relative velocity vectors), while eccentric orbits should preferentially have = 0 deg and = 180 deg (aligned position and velocity vectors).\n",
      "Sentence 113: This is illustrated in the bottom left panel of Fig. 3 .\n",
      "Sentence 114: While this method loses some information compared to the approach of Tokovinin (2020) , it has the advantage of not requiring estimates of stellar masses and is likely less sensitive to the effects of unrecognized higher-order multiples.\n",
      "Sentence 115: Hwang et al. (2022c) inferred an eccentricity distribution consistent with uniform at separations of 100 au , and steadily increasing eccentricities over 100 1000 au ( Fig. 3 , bottom right).\n",

      "Sentence 118: 9 .\n",
      "Sentence 119: They also found modest evidence for a shallower eccentricity distribution among wide binaries hosting inner subsystems.\n",
      "Sentence 120: The results of the studies by Tokovinin (2020) and Hwang et al. (2022c) are, broadly speaking, consistent: both studies find increasingly eccentric orbits at wider separations and a super-thermal eccentricity distribution at the widest separations.\n",
      "Sentence 121: Several models have been proposed to interpret these observations (e.g. Hamilton, 2022; Grishin and Perets, 2022; Xu et al., 2023; Hamilton and Modak, 2023; Rozner and Perets, 2023 ).\n",
      "Sentence 122: 3.1.5 The mass ratio distribution and twin binaries The homogeneity and well-understood selection function of the Gaia data allowed El-Badry et al. (2019) to infer the intrinsic mass ratio distribution of wide binaries as a function of primary mass and separation.\n",
      "Sentence 123: At all separations and masses, the mass ratio distribution is inconsistent with random pairing from the IMF, favoring higher mass ratios than expected in this scenario.\n",
      "Sentence 124: An unexpected result of this analysis was the discovery of a population of equal-mass twin binaries with mass ratios q 0 .\n",
      "Sentence 125: 95 extending to separations of several hundred to several thousand au, depending on primary mass.\n",

      "Sentence 127: 1 au ( Tokovinin, 2000 ), where it had been ascribed to formation processes that equalize the mass ratio, such as accretion from a circumbinary disk.\n",
      "Sentence 128: If the same mechanism is to form twin binaries at wide separations, some mechanism is required to widen the binaries after formation, since the twin excess extends to separations wider than the largest observed circumbinary disks.\n",
      "Sentence 129: Using speckle interferometry, Tokovinin (2023a) showed that an excess of twins is also present at 10100 au, below the Gaia resolution limit.\n",
      "Sentence 130: Hwang et al. (2022) showed that the eccentricities of the wide twins are on average higher than those of non-twins with similar separations.\n",
      "Sentence 131: That is, although twins today are observed with separations of hundreds to thousands of au, they generally reach separations of 10 100 au at periastron.\n",
      "Sentence 132: This observation lends credence to the hypothesis that twins formed via accretion from circumbinary disks, but further modeling is needed to work out the details of how their orbits were subsequently perturbed.\n",
      "Sentence 133: 3.1.6 Planets Another possible manifestation of correlated formation of wide binaries can be found in their planetary systems: several studies have reported an excess of planets in wide binaries whose orbits are aligned with the orbital plane of the wide binary ( Dupuy et al., 2022; Christian et al., 2022 ) and also with the spin axis of their host stars ( Rice et al., 2024 ).\n",
      "Sentence 134: This excess appears to extend to binary separations of at least several hundred au.\n",
      "Sentence 135: Like the excess of twin wide binaries, this observation seems to require spooky action at a distance on scales greater than typically associated with accretion processes during star formation.\n",
      "Sentence 136: 3.1.7 Metallicity dependence Variation of the binary fraction with metallicity has been a subject of many investigations over the last several decades, with many conflicting results in the literature.\n",
      "Sentence 137: In a meta-analysis of several different binary samples, Moe et al. (2019) found that when selection effects are accounted for, the close binary fraction of solar-type stars is strongly anti-correlated with metallicity, while the trend disappears at wide separations.\n",
      "Sentence 138: Correlations with metallicity for massive stars were found to be weaker.\n",
      "Sentence 139: The boundary between close and wide binaries was fuzzy but was proposed to correspond to the transition between the disk fragmentation and core fragmentation formation mechanisms.\n",
      "Sentence 140: El-Badry and Rix (2019) attempted to constrain the separation below which metallicity dependence appears using a sample of wide binaries from Gaia DR2 and metallicities from several wide-field surveys.\n",
      "Sentence 141: They found that the wide binary fraction is independent of metallicity at s 250 au but becomes anticorrelated with metallicity at closer separations, with the anticorrelation at 50 100 au almost as strong as Moe et al. (2019) and Badenes et al. (2018) found at 10 au.\n",
      "Sentence 142: They thus proposed that most binaries with separations 100 au form by disk fragmentation, as expected in the model advocated by Moe et al. (2019) .\n",
      "Sentence 143: Hwang et al. (2021) and Hwang et al. (2022b) focused on wide binaries ( 1000 au) and found more complicated behavior than the flat trend with metallicity reported by El-Badry and Rix (2019) : they found that the wide binary fraction peaks at [ Fe/H ] = 0 and declines towards both higher and lower metallicities.\n",
      "Sentence 144: Curiously, comparison of their sample and the sample used by El-Badry and Rix (2019) suggested that the discrepant results are in large part due to different treatments of hierarchical triples: El-Badry and Rix (2019) employed cuts on relative proper motion that excluded most triples, while Hwang et al. (2022b) included them, and the triples seem to cluster at [ Fe/H ] = 0 .\n",
      "Sentence 145: Niu et al. (2022) studied the metallicity dependence of the wide binary fraction further using metallicities from the LAMOST survey.\n",

(2022) studied the ruwe distributions of nearby white dwarfs and found evidence for a dearth of WD+WD binaries with au-scale orbits (i.e., the separation range to which ruwe is most sensitive), presumably because most orbits in this separation range are cleared out by common envelope evolution.\n",
      "Sentence 257: Andrew et al.

      "Sentence 410: The fact that eccentric orbits are underrepresented in the WD binary sample compared to the control sample validates that most of these objects are really WDs: tides are expected to circularize the orbits of WD binaries when the WD progenitors are red giants.\n",

      "Sentence 412: The period distribution of both WD binaries and the control sample displays a dip at P orb 1 yr and reduced sensitivity at short periods (due to a smaller astrometric ellipses at fixed distance) and long period (due to the finite duration of the Gaia observing baseline).\n",
      "Sentence 413: When these effects are accounted for, the period distribution of the WD + MS binaries revealed by Gaia is surprisingly similar to that of the control sample: the combined effects of common envelope evolution and/or stable mass transfer modify the period distribution (in the separation range Gaia is sensitive to) in undramatic ways.\n",

      "Sentence 457: Tokovinin (2023a) demonstrated that the presence of unresolved wide companions can lead to significant errors in RV orbital solutions as well as astrometric orbits, for multiple reasons.\n",
      "Sentence 458: First, light from wide companions dilutes the inferred RV variability amplitude of spectroscopic binaries and the photocenter wobble of astrometric binaries, resulting in underestimated variability amplitudes.\n",
      "Sentence 459: Second, the slitless, time-delay integrated nature of Gaia RVS spectroscopy requires the position of each source to be known accurately in order for the wavelength solution to be correct ( Boubert et al., 2019; Katz et al., 2023 ).\n",
      "Sentence 460: In unresolved and marginally resolved binaries, the source position in the focal plane can be different from what is assumed in processing the RVS spectra, leading to spurious velocity shifts on periods related to the scanning law.\n",
      "Sentence 461: Bashi et al. (2023) used a cleaned sample of spectroscopic orbits from DR3 to study the onset of tidal circularization in close binaries.\n",
      "Sentence 462: They found, contrary to some previous work, that the circularization period depends weakly (if at all) on stellar age, and more strongly on effective temperature, with warmer stars being circularized at shorter periods.\n",
      "Sentence 463: Of course, stellar ages are difficult to measure and correlated with effective temperature.\n",
      "Sentence 464: Searches for compact object companions have also been carried out with the SB1 solutions, with several works investigating the nature of binaries with the highest RV mass functions ( El-Badry and Rix, 2022; Fu et al., 2022; Jayasinghe et al., 2023; Rowan et al., 2024a ).\n",
      "Sentence 465: These searches have thus far revealed samples of high-mass white dwarfs (e.g. Yamaguchi et al., 2024b ) and many Algol-type mass-transfer binaries, but no high-confidence BHs or neutron stars.\n",
      "Sentence 466: Contamination is generically higher in spectroscopically-selected samples of compact object candidates than in astrometrically-selected samples, because unrecognized light from a luminous secondary tends to increase rather than decrease the inferred secondary mass. 5.3 Eclipsing and ellipsoidal binaries DR3 also included a sample of short-period binaries displaying photometric variability, including both eclipsing and ellipsoidal systems ( Mowlavi et al., 2023 ).\n",
      "Sentence 467: 86,918 sources have pure light curve solutions, while 155 have joint light curve + RV solutions.\n",
      "Sentence 468: Larger samples of eclipsing binaries have been assembled elsewhere (e.g. Soszyski et al., 2016 ), but the Gaia sample has the advantage of being all-sky.\n",
      "Sentence 469: For most sources published in DR3, the G band light curves have smaller per-epoch uncertainties than light curves produced by e.g. the ZTF and OGLE surveys, but have fewer photometric epochs.\n",
      "Sentence 470: Light curves were classified with a machine learning classifier ( Rimoldini et al., 2023 ).\n",
      "Sentence 471: As shown by Gomel et al. (2021) , a minimum mass ratio for an ellipsoidal variable can be derived from the variability amplitude, subject to the assumption that all observed variability is ellipsoidal.\n",
      "Sentence 472: Gomel et al. (2023) used this fact to select a sample of 6000 candidate ellipsoidal variables that may host a compact object companion, including 262 high-confidence systems with minimum mass ratios significantly larger than one.\n",
      "Sentence 473: Nagarajan et al. (2023) investigated the nature of this sample in more detail, carrying out spectroscopic follow-up on a sub-sample of the candidates.\n",
      "Sentence 474: They showed that a majority of the sample are contact binaries containing two luminous stars, but a small fraction may still contain compact objects.\n",
      "Sentence 475: 6 Distances for other binary samples and new discoveries Gaia astrometry and RV measurements are ill-suited for characterizing compact binaries: they produce small astrometric wobble and have components whose RVs cannot be reliably measured from RVS spectra because they are too faint, rapidly rotating, or lack strong lines in the RVS bandpass.\n",
      "Sentence 476: Gaia has nevertheless enabled significant progress in the study of these binaries by providing precise distance measurements.\n",
      "Sentence 477: Exotic binary populations for which Gaia distances have improved understanding include cataclysmic variables ( Pala et al., 2020; Abril et al., 2020; El-Badry et al., 2021b; Abrahams et al., 2022 ), AM CVn binaries ( Ramsay et al., 2018; Kupfer et al., 2018; van Roestel et al., 2022 ), low- and high-mass X-ray binaries ( Gandhi et al., 2019 ), ultracompact white dwarf binaries ( Burdge et al., 2020 ), and binary millisecond pulsars ( Moran et al., 2023; Koljonen and Linares, 2023 ).\n",
      "Sentence 478: I discuss a few studies in more detail below.\n",
      "Sentence 479: 6.1 Cataclysmic variables and AM cvn binaries Abril et al. (2020) and Abrahams et al. (2022) showed that the absolute magnitude of normal cataclysmic variables (CVs) is strongly correlated with orbital period (see Fig. 12 ).\n",
      "Sentence 480: Because the optical luminosity of most CVs is dominated by the accretion disk rather than the donor, this implies that the mass transfer rates decrease with orbital period in an ordered way.\n",
      "Sentence 481: While a similar correlation had been found previously based on distances estimated from near-infrared observations of CV donors ( Warner, 1987; Patterson, 2011 ), Gaia provides more accurate distances and reaches a broader range of CV subtypes.\n",
      "Sentence 482: Pala et al. (2020) assembled a nearly-complete sample of 42 cataclysmic variables within 150 pc (bottom panel of Fig. 12 ), from which they measured a CV space density of = 4 .\n",
      "Sentence 483: 8 0 . 8 + 0 .  6 1 0 6 pc 3 .\n",
      "Sentence 484: Volume complete samples are invaluable for the study of heterogeneous objects like CVs, since they make it possible to compare the relative frequencies of different subclasses with very different selection functions.\n",
      "Sentence 485: Pala et al. (2020) found that magnetic CVs (polars and intermediate polars) make up 36% of the 150 pc sample a much larger fraction than in earlier CV samples that were not volume limited.\n",
      "Sentence 486: Gaia showed a significant fraction of CVs previously thought to be in the 150 pc sample to be at larger distances.\n",
      "Sentence 487: A period gap at 2-3 h is clearly seen in the 150 pc sample ( Fig. 12 , lower right), but a large majority of CVs in the sample are faint systems with periods below the gap, which are underrepresented in flux-limited samples.\n",
      "Sentence 488: Nevertheless, period bouncers i.e., CVs that have passed through the period minimum, are evolving toward longer periods, and have degenerate brown dwarf donors make up only 7% of the sample, in strong tension with the predictions of evolutionary models.\n",
      "Sentence 489: Gaia found the distance of the prototypical AM CVn binary, AM CVn, to be less than half of that previously measured with the HST fine guidance sensor ( Ramsay et al., 2018 ).\n",
      "Sentence 490: This implies that the system has a factor of 5 lower mass transfer rate than previously believed, in better agreement with evolutionary models.\n",
      "Sentence 491: 6.2 X-ray binaries The Gaia DR3 distance to the black hole high-mass X-ray binary Cyg X-1, = 0 .\n",
      "Sentence 492: 468 0 .\n",
      "Sentence 493: 015 mas, is perfectly consistent with the recent VLBI measurement of 0 .\n",
      "Sentence 494: 46 0 .\n",
      "Sentence 495: 04 mas by Miller-Jones et al. (2021) , which resulted in a revised mass estimate of 21 M for the black hole the highest reasonably robust measurement for a BH X-ray binary.\n",
      "Sentence 496: Gaia proper motions and parallaxes also constrained the peculiar velocities of dozens of low-mass X-ray binaries containing black holes and neutron stars ( Zhao et al., 2023; ODoherty et al., 2023 ), revealing hints of an anti-correlation between natal kick velocity and compact object mass.\n",
      "Sentence 497: Proper motion measurements from Gaia showed that the low-mass X-ray binary V404 Cyg has a bound wide binary companion at 3500+ au, implying that it formed without a significant kick ( Burdge et al., 2024 ).\n",
      "Sentence 498: 6.3 Contact binaries Hwang and Zakamska (2020) used Gaia astrometry for contact binaries to infer their ages, making use of the fact that the velocity dispersion of stars in the Galactic disk increases with age.\n",
      "Sentence 499: They found that contact binaries are relatively old and likely evolved slowly from few-day initial periods by magnetic braking.\n",
      "Sentence 500: Linking them to triples (if they have tertiary companions, as e.g. Tokovinin et al. 2006 find most close binaries do) implies that original inner periods in those triples were of a few days.\n",
      "Sentence 501: 6.4 Hypervelocity white dwarfs By using Gaia astrometry to search for stars with high proper motions and large distances, Shen et al. (2018) identified a population of hypervelocity stars launched from thermonuclear supernovae in close WD binaries.\n",
      "Sentence 502: The stars observed today are single, but are believed to be runaways from close WD+WD binaries in which one component explodes and the other flees the scene at a velocity significantly exceeding the Galactic escape velocity.\n",
      "Sentence 503: The flight path of the youngest such star identified by Shen et al. (2018) can be traced back to a type Ia supernova remnant ( Fig. 13 , left panel), in strong support of this formation model.\n",
      "Sentence 504: More hypervelocity white dwarfs were identified by Raddi et al. (2019) and El-Badry et al. (2023c) , with velocities ranging from 500 to 2500 km s 1 .\n",
      "Sentence 505: Raddi et al. (2019) propose that the slower of these objects (LP 40-365 stars) are partially burned runaway accretors from single-degenerate thermonuclear supernovae, while the higher-velocity objects are runaway donors from double-degenerate binaries.\n",
      "Sentence 506: All the stars discovered so far sit between the WD cooling track and the main sequence in the CMD ( Fig. 13 , right panel), though Gnsicke et al. (2020) found a somewhat lower-velocity WD with similar abundances that is on the WD cooling track.\n",
      "Sentence 507: It is, perhaps, not surprising that the objects discovered so far are overluminous: they can be detected at much larger distances than similar objects on the WD cooling track, and their velocities are high enough that they will likely leave the Milky Way before they cool and contract to dimensions of normal WDs.\n",
      "Sentence 508: The thermal evolution and expected lifetimes of these objects are still uncertain, however, and models cannot yet simultaneously reproduce their velocities, ages, and luminosities (e.g. Zhang et al., 2019; Bauer et al., 2019, 2021 ).\n",
      "Sentence 509: As a result, the birth rate of hypervelocity WDs is quite uncertain.\n",
      "Sentence 510: Discovery of these objects has added further evidence that at least a fraction of type Ia supernovae come from double white dwarf binaries, but it remains unclear how large this fraction is ( Igoshev et al., 2023; El-Badry et al., 2023c; Braudo and Soker, 2024 ).\n",
      "Sentence 511: 7 DR4, DR5, and the road ahead The next major data release, Gaia DR4, is expected in early 2026.\n",
      "Sentence 512: DR4 will be transformative for binary star research perhaps even more so than DR2 and DR3 because it will include epoch-level astrometry for all sources.\n",
      "Sentence 513: This will allow self-consistent fitting of Gaia data and ground-based follow-up and make it possible to fit a variety of different models to the astrometry and RV data.\n",
      "Sentence 514: Perhaps most importantly, it will allow the community to explore the regime of lower-SNR astrometric data and experiment with different methods for filtering out spurious solutions, potentially yielding a large sample of BH and neutron star binaries, or other interesting and rare objects.\n",
      "Sentence 515: Epoch-level astrometric data will, however, represent a significant increase in complexity compared to the clean and mostly well-vetted solutions published so far.\n",
      "Sentence 516: Epoch-level data in a similar format that will be used in DR4 already exists for a small sample of a few hundred binaries with orbital solutions published by the Hipparcos mission and can serve as a valuable testing ground for analysis of epoch-level astrometric data while the community waits for DR4.\n",
      "Sentence 517: There is still significant work to be done in modeling the selection function of various classes of binaries discovered by Gaia .\n",
      "Sentence 518: I proposed in Section 5.1 that astrometric studies of binaries are superior for population modeling because the astrometric signal is easy to forward model.\n",
      "Sentence 519: This is true in principle, but it does not yet allow for straightforward modeling of the DR3 binary sample, because a variety of cuts that are challenging to model were applied.\n",
      "Sentence 520: More than a decade after launch, Gaia is still observing.\n",
      "Sentence 521: Less than a third of the observations Gaia has already collected have been published so far.\n",
      "Sentence 522: The final data release, DR5, is anticipated in 2030 or 2031 and will be based on nearly 11 years of observations from mid 2014 until propellant runs out in 2025.\n",
      "Sentence 523: These data will foreseeable yield good constraints on the orbits of binaries with periods reaching up to 20 years, and useful acceleration constraints at even longer periods (e.g. Andrews et al., 2023 ).\n",
      "Sentence 524: Gaias performance at close angular separations and thus, its resolution of wide binaries is also expected to improve significantly in future data releases ( Harrison et al., 2023 ).\n",
      "Sentence 525: The missions legacy of accurate, all-sky astrometry is unlikely to be superseded for several decades.\n",
      "Sentence 526: Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.\n",
