Printed in U S A TIME SCALES FOR Ca n EMISSION DECAY, ROTATIONAL BRAKING, AND LITHIUM DEPLETION A. Skumanich High Altitude Observatory, National Center for Atmospheric Research,* Boulder, Colorado Received 1971 June 21 ABSTRACT A comparison of the Ca+ emission luminosity—after correction for spectral-type effects—for the Pleiades, Ursa Major, and Hyades stars and the Sun indicate an emission decay which varies as the inverse square root of the age. Further, the rotational decay curve is found to satisfy the same law. It is further suggested that lithium depletion follows the+ same law but only as far as the Hyades age, after which the depletion proceeds exponentially. Since Ca emission is linearly proportional to magnetic field strength at the surface, one can predict that the surface fields are proportional to angular velocity and decay as the inverse square root. The above results are predicated on the standard Hyades age (0.4 billion years).\n",

            "The above results are predicated on the standard Hyades age (0.4 billion years). In an effort to put the relation between stellar age and the intensity of emission reversal of the Ca+ K- and H-lines (Wilson 1963; Wilson and Skumanich 1964) on a quantitative basis the author has reduced photoelectric observations of the cores of the K- and H-lines in the field stars (Wilson 1968), the Hyades (Wilson 1970), and the Sun (Wilson 1971) to a common spectral type (specifically, to B — F = 0.60). As Wilson (1970) has shown, K and H emission varies, for a given age group, with spectral type, so any meaningful age relation must be discussed after temperature differences are removed. The details of this procedure will be given elsewhere; our intent here is to compare the resulting (Ca+ emission, age)-relation with that for rotational braking and lithium depletion. In Figure 1 the temperature-corrected Ca“1\" emission luminosity is plotted (after subtraction of the “zero” point flux as given by the lower envelope of Wilson’s flux data) for the Sun and for the Hyades and Ursa Major stars. The latter are to be found among Wilson’s field-star data. The Hyades emission luminosity is taken as unity at all spectral types. Also plotted are the Ca+ emission data for the Pleiades as estimated from Kraft and Greenstein’s (1969) equivalent-width measures of the late-type stars in the Pleiades and Hyades. The indicated errors are based on the spread in data.\n",
            "\n",
            "The indicated errors are based on the spread in data. The figure indicates an inverse square-root law for the decay of Ca+ emission. Also plotted in Figure 1 are average equatorial velocities for the G stars in the Pleiades and Hyades and for the Sun (Kraft 1967 ; cf. Conti 1968 for further references of the data used). It is evident that the rotational data are in a constant proportion, within experimental errors, with the Ca+ emission data; i.e., the rotational decay also follows a square-root relation. The same can be said for the lithium-abundance data (for a review of this data, see van den Heuvel and Conti 1971) except that here the Sun has an overdepletion. It would appear that the lithium depletion follows the rotational and Ca+ emission decay through times of the order of the Hyades age and then proceeds exponentially with a e-folding time of 1.1 X 109 years. Alternately, the lithium abundance in the Sun may be underestimated by a factor of 10. According to Frazier’s data (Frazier 1970), Ca+ emission intensity, in a 1.1 Â band centered on the K-line, varies linearly with surface magnetic field strength. Thus it is appropriate to identify the stellar Ca+ emission luminosity with the (average) surface magnetic field. Figure 1 then implies that the average surface (dynamo) field is pro* The National Center for Atmospheric Research is sponsored by the National Science Foundation.\n",

SKUMANICH Vol. 171 Fig. 1.—Ca+ emission, rotation, and lithium abundance versus stellar age portional to the rotational velocity and decays as the inverse square root of the time as the star “cooks” on the main sequence. This remarkable result has been shown to be theoretically consistent by Durney (1972) on the basis of a simple model for the stellar wind. The above results are predicted on the basis of the “standard” age for the Hyades, viz., 0.4 X 109 years. If the revision by van den Heuvel (1969) proves to be correct, the derived square-root law will have to be revised. The proportionality between magnetic fields, rotation, and lithium abundance (except for the solar Li abundance) would be unchanged. The shift in the Hyades point due to the suggested age revision is indicated in Figure 1 by the arrows. As van den Heuvel and Conti (1971) show, one can fit the three points (using the revised age) with an exponential with an e-folding decay time of 1.1 X 109 years; however, the rotation curve was better fitted by two exponentials. The suggestion here, particularly when one tries to fit the Ca+ data (the Ursa Major point is important here), is that a power law is even better. The use of the revised Hyades age leads to an inverse cube-root law up to the Hyades. The subsequent decay would be more rapid for all three quantities.\n",

            "Target abstract: We describe an object in the Hubble Deep Field North with very unusual near-infrared properties. It is readily visible in Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS images at 1.6 μm and from the ground at 2.2 μm, but it is undetected (with S/N&lt;~2) in very deep WFPC2 and NICMOS data from 0.3 to 1.1 μm. The f<SUB>ν</SUB> flux density drops by a factor &gt;~8.3 (97.7% confidence) from 1.6 to 1.1 μm. The object is compact but may be slightly resolved in the NICMOS 1.6 μm image. In a low-resolution, near-infrared spectrogram, we find a possible emission line at 1.643 μm, but a reobservation at higher spectral resolution failed to confirm the line, leaving its reality in doubt. We consider various hypotheses for the nature of this object. Its colors are unlike those of known Galactic stars, except perhaps the most extreme carbon stars or Mira variables with thick circumstellar dust shells. It does not appear to be possible to explain its spectral energy distribution as that of a normal galaxy at any redshift without additional opacity from either dust or intergalactic neutral hydrogen. The colors can be matched by those of a dusty galaxy at z&gt;~2, by a maximally old elliptical galaxy at z&gt;~3 (perhaps with some additional reddening), or by an object at z&gt;~10 whose optical and 1.1 μm light have been suppressed by the intergalactic medium. Under the latter hypothesis, if the luminosity results from stars and not an AGN, the object would resemble a classical, unobscured protogalaxy, with a star formation rate &gt;~100 M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Such UV-bright objects are evidently rare at 2&lt;z&lt;12.5, however, with a space density several hundred times lower than that of present-day L<SUP>*</SUP> galaxies. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. (AURA), under NASA contract NAS5-26555.\n"
