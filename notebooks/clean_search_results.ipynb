Oh et al. (2017) found a separation distribution that increased monotonically toward wider separations and interpreted the wider pairs as moving groups; i.e., associations of stars that formed together and are still slowly drifting apart, despite no longer being gravitationally bound (see also Shaya and Olling, 2011 , who reported similar results based on Hipparcos data). Subsequently,  selected a wide binary candidate sample from TGAS with an emphasis on purity, using a Bayesian method to calculate the probability that a given pair of stars is gravitationally bound.\n"
