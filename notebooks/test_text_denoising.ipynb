      "---\n",
      "6 : This mechanism has found favor in the radio-loud objects, in the context of relativistically beamed emission from the jet (e.g. ) where direct measurement of source sizes and energy densities can be consistent with the observed X-ray fluxes and spectra.\n",

      "7 : However, the complementary application of using VLBI to accurately track spacecraft holds great promise (  ).\n",
      "---\n",
      "8 : A recent survey of transmission spectra (  ) spanning the optical and IR ranges provided important constraints on both the properties of clouds/hazes as well as the H 2 O abundances in 10 hot Jupiters.\n",

      "9 : It has been posited (  ) that the transition between these regimes provides ideal conditions for efficient fragmentation and introduces a characteristic mass scale to the system.\n",

      "12 : Although the existence of the correlation between UV and optical extinction curves within the Galaxy is generally accepted,  brought it into question by pointing out that by normalizing both the UV and optical slopes at V ,  may have introduced an artificial correlation even if there was none to begin with.\n",
      "---\n",

      "---\n",
      "16 : The fact that no such characteristic substructure is observed (although see  for the detection and interpretation of high-frequency substructure in the GS/E debris) could be interpreted as evidence for a non-axisymmetric component in the Milky Ways dark matter distribution.\n",
      "---\n",

      "---\n",
      "27 : Indeed, some commonly accessible elements can be subject to large biases: 90–99% of the Milky Way's interstellar Fe is locked into the solid phase (  ), a bias of >1 dex in the gas-phase abundance compared with the total.\n",
      "---\n",
      "28 : Although the compression ratio cannot be measured directly, X-ray imaging spectroscopy of both SNRs shows that the ejecta that are located very close to the forward shock, which is an observational consequence of a high compression ratio (Decourchelle et al. 2000).\n",

      "---\n",
      "31 : This result was confirmed by the work of , who further reported a distinct behaviour in faint (–) and powerful (–) radio galaxies, whereby the latter population (with the noticeable exception of classical double-lobed AGN) prefers to reside in regions of space where the amplitude of the spatial cross-correlation function is about four to five times that of inactive galaxies, while weak radio emitters show no tendency to belong to overdense structures.\n",

      "33 : One of the most surprising observations to date are those of the narrow absorption lines in the quasar 3C 191, which show evidence for partial covering at a large distance (28 kpc) from the nucleus (  ); it is difficult to understand how the small clouds have maintained their integrity over the outflow timescale of ∼3 × 10 7 year.\n",

      "34 : <italic>Recurrent shell flashes</italic> The relatively bright ( V ∼ 12 mag) optical counterpart of RX J0019.8+2156, studied on photographic plates taken over the past 100 years, appears to exhibit abrupt rises in optical magnitude by ∼0.5 mag, followed by a decay to its initial magnitude in ∼20–30 years (  ).\n",
      "---\n",
      "35 : Similarly, the optical depth is of the order 10 −3 –10 4 , i.e., ≲1/1, 000 high-redshift sources in the sky have detectable multiple images (e.g.,  ).\n",
      "---\n",
      "36 : For example, in the context of warm dark matter (WDM) models,  have shown that a WDM particle mass significantly below 1 keV would make it difficult to form any DM halos at z > 7 in order to host a high-redshift quasar.\n",
      "---\n",
      "37 : This eccentricity leads to a variation in the orbital speed of the gas with a minimum at apocenter that causes a local accumulation of gas density without particle trapping ().\n",
      "---\n",
      "38 : Compared with the recent empirical fit to the SFRD by  , the function in Equation 15 reaches its peak at a slightly higher redshift, with a lower maximum value of ψ and with slightly shallower rates of change at both lower and higher redshift, and produces 20% fewer stars by z = 0.

      "39 : The ELT could in principle allow the detection of some atmospheric signatures of habitable-zone super-Earths and Earth-like planets orbiting the nearest stars (  ).\n",
      "---\n",
      "40 : The first studies to correct for these limitations and construct an intrinsic Eddington-ratio distribution revealed striking results: the Eddington-ratio distribution can be characterized by a power law with a slope that is independent of both host-galaxy mass and redshift out to 2–3 ( ); however, we note that the current data would also be consistent with a broad log-normal distribution, if the peak of the distribution lies below current sensitivity limits.\n",
      "---\n",
      "41 : On the other hand, CEMP-no stars with [Fe/H] might either have a nucleosynthetic origin and reflect the properties of the elusive first (Pop III) stars, or be again the result of mass transfer from an AGB star in a binary system ( ).\n",
      "---\n",

      "---\n",
      "43 : If this signal is not observed, it implies that SMBHs formed later with massive seeds, SMBHs only occur in a small fraction of galaxies at high redshift, or accreting BH seeds emit significantly fewer or softer X-rays than would be expected based on low-redshift observations (the impact of a softer X-ray spectrum is computed in  ).\n",
      "---\n",
      "44 : However, a similar linewidth–size scaling law has been obtained between 0.05 pc and 20 pc with a different method ( ).\n",
      "---\n",
      "45 : Nature has somehow solved this problem in double radio sources () where the observed particle spectrum is p = 2.4, which gives ~ = 0.7, but whatever mechanism applies here is unlikely to work in the entirely dillerent conditions of electron cooling in the core of AGN.\n",
      "---\n",
      "46 : The enhancement depends on the amplitude of microturbulent broadening in Lyα which governs the number of fluorescent transitions that become accessible (  ).\n",

      "47 : The extremely high luminosities associated with these events make them readily visible even at high redshifts, as demonstrated by GRB 090423, which has a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of z ≈ 8.2 (  ) and GRB 090429B, which has a photometric redshift of z ≈ 9.4 (  ).\n",

      "---\n",
      "49 : The detection of X-ray and gamma-ray flares from the Crab nebula ( ) proves phenomenologically that PWN can be variable on much shorter timescales than previously thought possible.\n",

      "50 : A particular promising mechanism is that discovered by 35 However, an alternative explanation may be varying magnetic fields due to passages of large scale plasma waves ().\n",
