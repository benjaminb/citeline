You are an expert researcher and data analyst. Your task is to determine if the following titles refer to the same academic paper.

## Understanding
- A noisy dataset contained titles of academic papers often contained typos, formatting issues, author names, or other variations making the title different than the canonical title in the publisher's database
- Fuzzy matching attempted to resolve the canonical title for each dataset title

## Task
Given a dataset title and a candidate canonical title, determine if they refer to the same academic paper or not. Write out your reasoning, then a boolean for is_match. If you are not confident that the titles match, mark it false.
Guidelines:
- Ignore typos and OCR errors (e.g., "Biligual" vs "Bilingual")
- Ignore author names, institutions, or other metadata appended to title (e.g., "Title Here John Smith" → "Title Here")
- Ignore minor wording differences (e.g., "based" vs "tree-based")
- Ignore prefixes like "Squibs:" or section markers
- Completely different papers should be marked false
- Overly generic dataset titles should be marked false
- To be marked true the titles must be semantically equivalent, not merely related

## Examples
- Dataset Title: "A NeuralProbabilistic Language ModelSmith,Joe et al"
  Candidate Title: "A Neural Probabilistic Language Model"
  reasoning: ignoring the author info in the dataset title, it almost exactly matches the candidate title
  is_match: true

- Dataset Title: ".]"
  Candidate Title: "New Advances in Computational Linguistics"
  reasoning: the dataset title is mis-encoded since '.]' could not realistically be a title for a paper. Impossible to tell if the candidate title refers to the same intended paper
  is_match: false

- Dataset Title: "Natural Language Processing"
  Candidate Title: "Natural Language Processing Benefits from Attention Mechanisms"
  reasoning: the dataset title is extremely generic so I cannot confidently say that the candidate title is a match
  is_match: false

## Input
- Dataset Title: "{dataset_title}"
- Candidate Title: "{candidate_title}"

Write your answer in JSON format with the keys 'reasoning' for your reasoning and 'is_match' for your determination (true if they match, false otherwise).
