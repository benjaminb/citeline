You are an expert researcher looking for citaions for your research. You've written a current sentence and have to decide if the chunk below (from another research paper) suggests that you should cite the paper the chunk came from.

Your task is to read the current sentence and chunk, then write true if the sentence should cite the chunk, false otherwise.

## Rules
- Write true if it seems like the sentence is citing the chunk
- Write false if the chunk and sentence do not seem related
