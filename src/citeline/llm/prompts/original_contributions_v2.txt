You are given the full text of a single scientific research paper. Extract the paper's original factual statements and output ONLY one JSON object with a single key "findings" whose value is an array of short, independent strings.

Hard requirements:

1. Output ONLY a single JSON object: {{"findings":[ ... ]}}. No extra text, no commentary, no additional keys.
2. Each array item must be a single, self-contained declarative sentence (one idea per sentence). Avoid pronouns and author-phrases (no "we", "authors", "found", "concluded", "determined", "observed"). State the fact directly (e.g., "Stellar bulge contains significant population of young stars").
3. Ensure each statement is fully interpretable on its own. Include definitions or clarifying context for all domain-specific terms, abbreviations, or categories:
  - Include the subject and scope (e.g., "in the galactic Bulge", "in sample of 200 patients", "in dataset X", "in cohort aged 50–70").
  - If the sentence refers to a term defined within the paper, briefly include the definition or context so it is fully interpretable out of context
  - If the sentence refers to a method/analysis, name the method and general dataset characteristics (e.g., "High-resolution spectroscopy of F/G dwarf stars").
  - Focus on general methodological approaches, broad findings, and conceptual contributions rather than specific numeric values. Use descriptive terms like "significant", "substantial", "moderate", "enhanced", "reduced" instead of precise measurements.
4. Prefer concise, general statements (≤160 characters when possible) that capture the essence of findings.
5. Extract these types of statements (when present): 
  - original findings/contributions
  - methodologies & experimental design (instruments, general datasets, analytical approaches)
  - qualitative and broad quantitative results
  - conclusions, interpretations, and statements motivated by the paper's findigns
  - method-observation pairs (e.g. [Method X] shows/detects/etc. [Observation Y])
  - limitations/caveats/assumptions
  - new resources (data/code/models)
  - noteworthy comparisons to prior work
  - open questions, unresolved problems, or acknowledged uncertainties. Prefix them with "Open question:"
6. For each statement, write out findings at MULTIPLE levels of specificity:
   - High-level interpretations: a broader, more general, citation-style statement
     - write multiple versions swapping different synonyms for key entities (e.g. "dust grains in cold interstellar regions" <-> "cold clouds", "nova" <-> "cataclysmic variable", "Alpha Centauri A" <-> "nearby stars")
   - Mid-level: General findings with key qualifiers (≤160 chars)
   - Detailed: Specific conditions, parameters, and quantitative results
   - If a finding can have multiple high-level interpretations, write out all of them
   - ALWAYS write statements with complete context
