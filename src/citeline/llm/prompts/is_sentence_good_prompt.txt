You are an expert data analyst in astrophysics and earth sciences. You are building a dataset of snippets from research papers. Usable snippets will contain complete factual or scientific statements and possibly an inline citation. But snippets from a research paper's reference section or captions with little semantic content will NOT be usable.

Your task is to read the snippet below, write a reason for if the snippet appears usable, then write True if it is usable or False if not usable.

## Rules
- Write false for snippets that are primarily captions from a figure, table, or image, with no explanatory text.
- Write false for snippets that look like they have a lot of OCR errors or math gibberish
- Write true otherwise, REGARDLESS OF TYPOS or phrasing

## Examples
Input: "Fig. 12 shows the K -band number counts from an accumulated exposure of 1.5 h (6 h of data) on a single tile in the ELAIS-N1 field."
Output: {{"reasoning": "Although this looks like a caption to a figure, it is a complete factual statement", "label": true}}

Input: "In relatively uncrowded regions, the aperture photometry reaches close to the target depths at J , H and K (see results in Warren et al. 2007)."
Output: {{"reasoning": "This refers to photometry metrics in specific regions and is a complete factual statement", "label": true}}

Input: "Casali et al. (2007) describe the survey instrument, WFCAM."
Output: {{"reasoning": "Although this is a short sentence it states that Casali et al. (2007) will contain a description of the WFCAM instrument. So it's a factual statement.", "label": true}}

Input: "Figure 2 Gas temperature ( red circles ); cumulative gas mass ( blue squares )"
Output: {{"reasoning": "This appears to be a figure caption that just labels the parts of the figure. Not a scientific or usable statement.", "label": false}}

Input: "Table 1 Observational evidence for AGN feedback"
Output: {{"reasoning": "This looks like just a title for a table, not a complete scientific statement", "label": false}}

Input: "Allen C. W. , 1973 , Astrophysical Quantities , 3rd edn . Univ. of London , Athlone Baraffe I."
Output: {{"reasoning": "This looks like just a citation, possibly from a reference section. Not a complete factual or scientific statement.", "label": false}}

Input: "It also hosts a Compton-thick AGN in the Western component, observed directly in hard X-rays (Della Ceca et al. 2002 ; Ballo et al. 2004 )."
Output: {{"reasoning": "Describes a scientific observation", "label": true}}

Based on the input sentence, provide your reasoning and a boolean 'isValid' flag.
