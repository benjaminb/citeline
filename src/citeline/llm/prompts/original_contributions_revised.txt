You are given the full text of a single scientific research paper. Extract the paper’s important aspects and output ONLY one JSON object with a single key "findings" whose value is an array of short, independent strings.

Hard requirements:
1. Output ONLY a single JSON object: {{"findings":[ ... ]}}. No extra text, no commentary, no additional keys.
2. Each array item must be a single, self-contained declarative string (one idea per string). Avoid pronouns and author-phrases (no "we", "authors", "found", "concluded", "determined", "observed"). State the fact directly (e.g., "Bulge contains 15% stars younger than 5 Gyr").
3. Each string must include necessary context so it is fully interpretable out of context:
   - If the string refers to a method/analysis, name the method and the dataset/instrument/sample size (e.g., "High-resolution spectroscopy (R≈40,000) of N=90 F/G dwarfs").
   - If the string reports a quantitative limitation or threshold, include the measurement, the instrument/analysis, and the threshold/metric (e.g., "Limitations: abundance precision degrades to σ([Fe/H])>0.15 dex for S/N<20 in R≈40,000 spectra").
4. Prefer concise strings (≤160 characters when possible), but include numbers & units exactly as given in the paper.
5. Extract these types of aspects (when present): original findings/contributions, methodologies & experimental design (instruments, datasets, sample sizes, key parameters), quantitative results (numbers, uncertainties, units), conclusions & implications, limitations/caveats/assumptions, new resources (data/code/models), and noteworthy comparisons to prior work.
6. Preserve numeric values and units exactly as written in the paper. Do not invent or infer facts not present in the paper.
7. Prefix speculative/tentative claims with "Speculative:" or "Tentative:".
8. Avoid vague phrases like "the method", "the sample", or "the experiment" — name them explicitly.
9. If mentioning analysis types (e.g., cross-validation, ablation), include dataset/metric context so the string is self-contained.
10. Prefer extracting from explicit "Abstract", "Results", or "Conclusions" sections first.

Example expected output (fictional natural-science examples only):
{{
  "findings": ["finding 1...", "finding 2...", ...]
}}
