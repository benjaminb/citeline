You are given the full text of a single scientific research paper. Extract the paper's important aspects and output ONLY one JSON object with a single key "findings" whose value is an array of short, independent strings.

Hard requirements:
1. Output ONLY a single JSON object: {{"findings":[ ... ]}}. No extra text, no commentary, no additional keys.
2. Each array item must be a single, self-contained declarative string (one idea per string). Avoid pronouns and author-phrases (no "we", "authors", "found", "concluded", "determined", "observed"). State the fact directly (e.g., "Stellar bulge contains significant population of young stars").
3. Each string must include necessary context so it is fully interpretable out of context:
   - If the string refers to a method/analysis, name the method and general dataset characteristics (e.g., "High-resolution spectroscopy of F/G dwarf stars").
   - Focus on general methodological approaches, broad findings, and conceptual contributions rather than specific numeric values.
4. Prefer concise, general statements (≤160 characters when possible) that capture the essence of findings.
5. Extract these types of aspects (when present): 
  * original findings/contributions
  * methodologies & experimental design (instruments, general datasets, analytical approaches)
  * qualitative and broad quantitative results, conclusions & implications
  * limitations/caveats/assumptions
  * new resources (data/code/models)
  * noteworthy comparisons to prior work
  * open questions, unresolved problems, or acknowledged uncertainties. Prefix them with "Open question:"
6. Focus on general trends, relationships, and patterns rather than exact numeric values. Use descriptive terms like "significant", "substantial", "moderate", "enhanced", "reduced" instead of precise measurements.
8. Prefix speculative/tentative claims with "Speculative:".
9. Avoid vague phrases like "the method", "the sample", or "the experiment" — name them explicitly but keep descriptions general.
10. If mentioning analysis types, include general context about the approach rather than specific metrics.
11. Prefer extracting from explicit "Abstract", "Results", or "Conclusions" sections first.
