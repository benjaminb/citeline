You are given the full text of a single scientific research paper. Extract all factual statements asserted or utilized in this paper, including both novel contributions and descriptions of methods/instruments/data used.

Hard requirements:

1. Output ONLY a single JSON object: {{"findings":[ ... ]}}. No extra text, no commentary, no additional keys.
2. Each array item must be a single, self-contained declarative sentence (one idea per sentence). Avoid pronouns and author-phrases (no "we", "authors", "found", "concluded", "determined", "observed"). State the fact directly (e.g., "Stellar bulge contains significant population of young stars").
3. Ensure each statement is fully interpretable on its own. Include definitions or clarifying context for all domain-specific terms, abbreviations, or categories:
  - Include the subject and scope (e.g., "in the galactic Bulge", "in sample of 200 patients", "in dataset X", "in cohort aged 50–70").
  - If the sentence refers to a term defined within the paper, briefly include the definition or context so it is fully interpretable out of context
  - If the sentence refers to a method/analysis, name the method and general dataset characteristics (e.g., "High-resolution spectroscopy of F/G dwarf stars").
  - Focus on general methodological approaches, broad findings, and conceptual contributions rather than specific numeric values. Use descriptive terms like "significant", "substantial", "moderate", "enhanced", "reduced" instead of precise measurements.
3. Ensure each statement is fully interpretable on its own. Include definitions or clarifying context for all domain-specific terms, abbreviations, or categories:
  - Include the subject and scope (e.g., "in the galactic Bulge", "in sample of 200 patients", "in dataset X", "in cohort aged 50–70").
  - If discussing a subset, subgroup, or category, ALWAYS include what it's a subset OF.
    - BAD: "Outliers have masses from 9.4 to 11.1"
    - GOOD: "Galaxies offset from mass-metallicity relation (MZR) have masses from 9.4 to 11.1"
  - If the sentence refers to a term defined within the paper, briefly include the definition or context so it is fully interpretable out of context.
  - For well-established acronyms and abbreviations in the field, include BOTH the full term and acronym on first use:
    - Use the format: "full term (ACRONYM)" 
    - Examples: "mass-metallicity relation (MZR)", "cosmic microwave background (CMB)", "supermassive black hole (SMBH)", "active galactic nucleus (AGN)", "asymptotic giant branch (AGB)", "second generation (2G)"
     - Apply this to: major concepts, standard measurements, established relations, common astrophysical objects, and widely-recognized instruments
     - If a term appears in multiple statements, include the acronym definition in each statement (since each must be independently interpretable)
  - If the sentence refers to a method/analysis, name the method and general dataset characteristics (e.g., "High-resolution spectroscopy of F/G dwarf stars").
  - Focus on general methodological approaches, broad findings, and conceptual contributions rather than specific numeric values. Use descriptive terms like "significant", "substantial", "moderate", "enhanced", "reduced" instead of precise measurements.
4. Prefer concise, general statements (≤160 characters when possible) that capture the essence of findings.
5. Extract these types of statements (when present): 
  - original findings/contributions
  - methodologies & experimental design (instruments, general datasets, analytical approaches)
  - qualitative and broad quantitative results
  - instruments/tools used (even if established), with their purpose and capabilities
  - conclusions, interpretations, and statements motivated by the paper's findigns
  - method-observation pairs (e.g. [Method X] shows/detects/etc. [Observation Y])
  - limitations/caveats/assumptions
  - new resources (data/code/models)
  - noteworthy comparisons to prior work
  - open questions, unresolved problems, or acknowledged uncertainties. Prefix them with "Open question:"
6. For each statement, write out findings at MULTIPLE levels of specificity:
   - High-level interpretations: a broader, more general, citation-style statement
   - Mid-level: General findings with key qualifiers (≤160 chars)
   - Detailed: Specific conditions, parameters, and quantitative results
   - If a finding can have multiple high-level interpretations, write out all of them
   - ALWAYS write statements with complete context
7. Before finalizing each statement, verify: "If I gave this sentence to someone unfamiliar with the paper, would they understand what population/sample/reference frame is being discussed?" If no, add the missing context.
