    "1 INTRODUCTION The UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) can be considered the near-infrared (near-IR) counterpart of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000).",
    # 1.1
    "1.1 Origins and nature of project The UKIDSS survey concept first emerged in 1998 while making the funding case for the WFCAM instrument itself, but eventually became a formal refereed proposal to the UKIRT Board in 2001 March, submitted by a consortium of 61 UK astronomers.",
    "The project is unusual compared to previous large survey projects, being neither private, nor conducted by a public body on behalf of the community.",
    "The consortium has no data privileges, and does not plan the scientific exploitation of the survey; its purpose is to make the survey happen, on behalf of the ESO community.",
    # 1.2
    "1.2 Technical reference papers This paper is one of a set of five which provide the reference technical documentation for UKIDSS.",
    "Casali et al. (2007) describe the survey instrument, WFCAM.",
    "The data flow system for WFCAM is described by Irwin et al. (in preparation) and Hambly et al. (in preparation).",
    "The photometric system is described in Hewett et al. (2006).",
    "Hewett et al. present the measured passband transmisssions, and use synthetic colours of various classes of astronomical object to produce expected colour equations between certain WFCAM, SDSS and 2MASS filters.",
    # 1.3
    "1.3 Plan of paper This paper begins with a description of the science goals of UKIDSS, and some illustrations of how the survey design will achieve them.",
    # Section 2 2.1
    "2 SCIENCE GOALS 2.1 General goals The primary goal of UKIDSS is to produce IR sky atlases and catalogues as a fundamental resource of lasting significance analogous to the various Schmidt photographic sky surveys of the 1970s and onwards (Hambly et al. 2001, and references therein), and to the SDSS survey of modern times (York et al. 2000).",
    "The strength of a survey is of course its potential for multiple use over many years",
    "The general features of the five planned survey components are described in Table 2.",
    "In the following sections, we summarize the scientific goals of each survey component, and overall survey quality goals.",
    "The scope of the surveys is illustrated in an interesting way in Fig. 1.",
    "In practice, achieving the science goals of UKIDSS will depend not only on the depths and areas achieved, but also on the survey quality",
    # 2.2
    "2.2 Headline science goals To develop a plan beyond this very general concept, we encouraged the formation of groupings within the consortium to promote distinct survey components and science goals.",
    # 2.3
    "2.3 Goals of the Large Area Survey (LAS) The LAS aims to map as large a fraction of the Northern Sky as feasible (4000 deg2) within a few hundred nights, which when combined with the SDSS, produces an atlas covering almost an order of magnitude in wavelength.",
    "The LAS, when combined with the matching SDSS data, will produce a catalogue of half a million galaxies with colours and spectra, and several million galaxies with photometric redshifts, will detect thousands of rich clusters out to z = 1, and will find 10 times more brown dwarfs than 2MASS.",
    "We are particularly driven, however, by three especially exciting prospects.",
    # 2.4
    "2.4 Goals of the Galactic Plane Survey (GPS) The GPS aims to map half of the Milky Way to within a latitude of ±5°.",
    "Like the high-latitude LAS, the GPS has its prime importance as a fundamental resource for future astronomy.",
    # 2.5
    "2.5 Goals of the Galactic Clusters Survey (GCS) The GCS aims to survey 10 large open star clusters and star formation associations, covering a total of 1067 deg2 using the standard single pass depth (see Section 3.2) plus a second pass in K for proper motions, giving a depth of Z = 20.4, Y = 20.3, J = 19.5, H = 18.6, K = 18.6.",
    "The GCS is the most targeted of our surveys, being aimed at the crucial question of the substellar IMF.",
    "To find extreme objects – the very nearest examples, the lowest mass objects – the LAS is better.",
    # 2.6
    "2.6 Goals of the Deep Extragalactic Survey (DXS) The DXS aims to map 35 deg2 of sky to a 5σ point-source sensitivity of J = 22.3 and K = 20.8 in four carefully selected, multiwavelength survey areas.",
    "The number of deep, multiwavelength survey fields has increased dramatically in the past 5 yr with the up-grade of existing facilities and new satellite missions.",
    # 2.7
    "2.7 Goals of the Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) The UDS aims to map 0.77 deg 2 to a 5σ point-source sensitivity of .",
    "Deep near-IR surveys are crucial for obtaining a more complete census of the Universe at these epochs.",
    # Section 3 3.1
    "3 IMPLEMENTATION WITH THE UKIRT WIDE FIELD CAMERA 3.1 General characteristics of telescope and camera UKIDSS is implemented using WFCAM on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), which is operated by the Joint Astronomy Centre (JAC), an establishment of the UK’s Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC).",
    "WFCAM is described in detail by Casali et al. (2007).",

    "(iv) Schedule blocks and survey definition.",
    "Actual survey data collection rate in practice is considered in Section 7.",
    # 3.3
    "3.3 Survey calibration The UKIDSS data are calibrated to magnitudes in the Vega system.",
    "There are plenty of unsaturated 2MASS stars in every data frame – in the range 60–1000, dependent on Galactic Latitude.",
    # Section 4
    "4 SURVEY DESIGN The design of the UKIDSS survey components was driven by a mixture of the legacy ambition, practical limitations, and specific science goals.",
    "Table 3 summarizes the design parameters of each of the five UKIDSS survey components.",
    # 4.1
    "4.1 Microstepping strategy Microstepping improves the sampling, but has the disadvantage of making overheads worse.",
    "With 2 × 2 microstepping, repeated after an offset, the exposure time in the shallow surveys (mostly 40 s total integration) is 5 s.",
    # 4.2
    "4.2 Design of the Large Area Survey The main science goals of the LAS require as large a volume as possible, with increased area being a more efficient use of time than increased depth.",
    "The detailed implementation also depends on the weather constraints used.",
    "Field selection for the LAS was designed to have a good spread in RA, to have a reasonable amount of sky coverage at lower declinations, for follow-up on ESO telescopes"
    # 4.3
    "4.3 Design of the Galactic Plane Survey The GPS aims to map as much of the Galactic plane as possible to a latitude of ±5°.",
    "One of the goals of GPS is the discovery and study of YSOs, and in particular molecular outflows.",
    "The area to be mapped is shown in Fig. 6.",
    "Normal procedure is to do all bands in one visit, as colours are important and many objects are variable.",
    # 4.4
    "4.4 Design of the Galactic Clusters Survey The design of the GCS is relatively simple.",
    "The strategy is to cover the majority 1067 deg 2 in a single pass in K , to provide the proper motion baseline, within the initial two-year plan.",
    # 4.5
    "4.5 Design of the Deep Extragalactic Survey The DXS aims to detect galaxies at redshifts of 1–1.5.",
    "The survey area was driven by the aim to sample large-scale structure at on scales and volume comparable to that measured locally (≈100 Mpc and 0.2 Gpc 3 , respectively).",
    "The number and position of the DXS survey fields were chosen to provide the best combination of quality and coverage of supporting, multiwavelength dat, to maximize the spatial scale",
    "The total area covered by the DXS within the full seven-year span of UKIDSS will depend on weather and competition from other surveys (most notably the UDS) but our goal is",
    "For DXS, star-galaxy separation at faint magnitudes will be very important",
    # 4.6
    "4.6 Design of the Ultra Deep Survey The UDS aims to go as deep as possible in a single contiguous WFCAM tile.",
    "As with the DXS, we need good sampling to enable star-galaxy separation at faint magnitudes, and multiple jitters to overcome detector systematics when stacking.",
    "Although the headline science goals of the UDS are to find high redshift galaxies which will be extremely faint at optical wavelengths, the legacy value of the survey will be increased by the presence of complementary ultradeep optical data.",
    # 4.7
    "4.7 Two-year goals We aim to complete self contained and scientifically valuable data sets on a two-year time-scale.",
    # 5
    "5 DATA PROCESSING AND DATA PRODUCTS The commitment to making a public survey requires the construction of complete, reliable, tested, and documented products from the raw data.",
    "Overall data flow is as follows.",
    # 5.1
    "5.1 The WFCAM pipeline The general philosophy behind the pipeline processing is that all fundamental data products are FITS multi-extension files with headers describing the data taking protocols in sufficient detail to trigger the appropriate pipeline processing components, and that all derived information, QC measures, photometric and astrometric calibration and processing details, are also incorporated within the FITS headers.",
    "After conversion at the summit from Starlink NDF to fits files, to reduce the data storage, I/O overheads and transport requirements, we make use of lossless Rice tile compression",
    "The data-processing strategy attempts to minimize the use of on-sky science data to form ‘calibraion’ images for removing the instrumental signature.",
    "Each night of data is pipeline processed independently using the master calibration twilight flats"
    # 5.2 The WFCAM science archive
    "5.2 The WFCAM science archive Data processing delivers standard nightly pipeline-processed images and associated single passband catalogues, complete with astrometric and first-pass photometric calibrations and all associated ‘meta’ data in flat FITS files.",
    "Source merging is computationally very intensive, UKIDSS catalogues are extremely large, and the VDFS system is designed to scale to the even larger expected VISTA products.",
    "The QC process is a joint responsibility of the UKIDSS consortium and the VDFS project and is a semi-automated process.",
    "Image data volume is typically ∼200 GBytes per night, with catalogue and descriptive data being typically ∼10 per cent of that figure.",
    "Finally, we note that the WSA has been developed throughout with Virtual Observatory compatibility in mind.",
    "The WFCAM Science Archive 5 (WSA) is much more than a simple repository of the basic data products described previously.",
    # 6 SCIENCE VERIFICATION PROGRAMME
    "6 SCIENCE VERIFICATION PROGRAMME Because the consortium has no proprietary rights, and no formal role in deriving science results from the data (as opposed to facilitating their exploitation), in this paper we have avoided showing science results from the released data.",
    "Following the technical commissioning of WFCAM, and before the commencement of formal survey operations in 2005 May, the UKIDSS consortium undertook a modest set of test observations, as an ‘SV’ programme.",
    # 6.1 Science verification results for the LAS
    "6.1 Science verification results for the LAS The LAS SV programme covered some 20 deg², achieving close (0.2 mag) to the standard shallow depth in filters Y, J, H and K.",
    "A second aim was to test the location of quasars by combining UKIDSS and SDSS colours.",
    # 6.2 Science verification results for the GPS
    "6.2 Science verification results for the GPS The SV data for the Galactic Plane Survey included a 0.75 deg² region of the Taurus–Auriga–Perseus molecular cloud complex.",
    "The central 25 per cent of the M17 tile is shown in Fig. 9.",
    "At the present time only aperture photometry is available in the WFCAM Science Archive.",
    "The quality of the photometry is illustrated in the two colour–colour diagrams in Fig. 10, each of which shows those sources within a single",
    "The right-hand panel of Fig. 10 illustrates a crowded field with high extinciton",
    "Since the main-sequence curve is almost parallel to the reddening vector, it appears that additional colours will be required",
    "Profile-fitting photometry will be included in a future release of UKIDSS data if it is found to improve the photometric precision.",
    "In relatively uncrowded regions, the aperture photometry reaches close to the target depths",
    "A full analysis of the data quality in the GPS and some results from the SV data will be presented in a future paper (Lucas et al., in preparation).",
    # 6.3 Science verification results for the GCS
    "6.3 Science verification results for the GCS SV observations for the GCS yielded eight tiles in each of three targets observable at that time",
    "Overplotted are 5 Myr theoretical isochrones shifted to a distance of 145 pc",
    # 6.4
    "6.4 Science verification results for the DXS and UDS The DXS and UDS undertook a joint SV programme to establish",
    "One of the scientific goals of DXS and UDS is to locate extremely red objects (EROs).",
    # 7 SURVEY PROGRESS
    "7 SURVEY PROGRESS The final version of this paper is being written in 2007 April. We have made an ‘Early Data Release (EDR)’ ( Dye et al. 2006), and First and Second Data Releases (DR1 and DR2; Warren et al. 2007a,b).",
    # 7.1
    "7.1 Survey quality achieved After filtering data through the QC process, UKIDSS is achieving its design goals, with the partial exception of depth in stacked surveys, which is expected to improve in later releases.",
    "(i) Image quality.",
    "(ii) Photometric accuracy . Calibration uses 2MASS stars over the whole of each frame",
    "(iii) Astrometric accuracy.",
    "(iv) Depth.",
    "(v) Data base utility.",
    "(vi) Reliability and completeness.",
    # 7.2
    "7.2 Survey completion rate Up to DR1 release, the rate at which the survey has accumulated has been slower than hoped.",
    "7.3 First utilization of UKIDSS In Section 6, we have shown analyses undertaken by the consortium with SV data.",
    # 7.4
    "7.4 Survey releases Data access policy for UKIDSS is set by the UKIRT Board",
    "It is intended to make UKIDSS data available in a series of well defined staged releases.",
    "Further releases are likely to take place thereafter every six months or so.",

    "1 INTRODUCTION In the standard cosmological picture, the mass density of the Universe is dominated by collisionless dark matter, and structure in this component forms by hierarchical gravitational clustering starting from low-amplitude seed fluctuations, with smaller objects collapsing first, and then merging to form larger and larger objects.",
    "The analytical approach was pioneered by Press & Schechter (1974, hereafter PS), who derived, rather heuristically, an expression for the mass spectrum of collapsed, virialized objects resulting, via dissipationless gravitational clustering of initially cold matter, from initial density fluctuations that obeyed Gaussian statistics.",
    "Kauffmann & White (1993) have extended the utility of the analytical results of BCEK and Bower (1991) by presenting a Monte Carlo method of generating merger trees, describing the formation history of haloes, that are consistent with the analytical conditional mass function.",

    "Our aim in this paper is to test the analytical results for the merging of dark haloes derived in Paper I against a set of large N-body simulations.",
    "An important question that arises when comparing analytical predictions for mass functions, merger rates etc. of dark haloes with the corresponding quantities in N-body simulations is how best to identify the haloes in the simulations.",

    "2.5 Self-similar models The analytical results presented above make no special assumptions about the functions \(\sigma(M)\) and \(\delta_c(t)\), except that they are monotonic.",

    "2.6 Choice of filtering and collapse threshold The BCEK derivations of the PS mass function and of the conditional mass function are based on sharp \(k\)-space filtering.",
    "In this paper, we adopt an empirical approach to the choice of filter and M(R) relation.",
    "A related issue concerns the choice of collapse threshold, which for",

    "4.3 Spherical overdensity (SO) groups The second method we apply, which we call spherical overdensity (SO), is based on finding spherical regions in a simulation having a certain mean overdensity, which we denote by \(\kappa = \langle \rho \rangle / \bar{\rho}\).",
    "We will present comparisons for SO groups with spherical overdensity 7C = 180, chosen to agree with the spherical collapse model. ",
    "Our spherical overdensity algorithm has many similarities to the method used by Warren et al. (1992)",
    "4.4 n=-2 log(M/M.) n=-1 Comparison of methods The percolation method has the advantage that it is simple, relatively fast, and does not make any assumption about the geometry of the groups.",

    "Since the scaling of the mass functions in the simulations is consistent with self-similarity, we average the results for all output times together to increase their precision, weighting the contribution of \(d/d \ln M\) in each bin in \(M/M_s\) in proportion to the number of haloes in that bin for each output time.",
    "5.2 683 Choice of filter and density threshold We now consider the choice of filter and collapse threshold in the Press-Schechter mass function (cf. Section 2.6).",
    "We first test how well the N-body mass functions for different initial power spectra agree",

For each group of mass M identified at a particular output epoch at which the expansion factor equals ö0, we identify its most massive progenitor at all earlier output times",

    "We also investigated the formation times of groups identified using the FOF algorithm with differing values of the linking length b and for groups defined by SO",
    "In Paper I, we defined a scaled variable",
    "8 CONCLUSIONS We have tested the statistical predictions of the Press-Schechter model",
    "Dark matter haloes were identified in the simulations using two alternative methods. The first was the standard percolation or ‘friends of friends’ method",
    "To apply the analytical formulae for mass functions and merging, three choices have to be made.",
    "Overall, there seems little to choose between the different types of filtering, but we have concentrated on the top hat filter in most of our comparisons because this is more standard.",
    "With the same choices of filter, threshold, and groupfinding, we also find remarkable agreement between the halo merger rates measured from the simulations and the analytical predictions",
    "We end with a caveat.",

    "With the metal-dependent HN fraction (blue short-dashed line), at Z ≳ Z ⊙ , the metal production from core-collapse supernovae is assumed to be very small compared to SNe Ia; the present-day HN fraction is only 1%, and the rest of the massive supernovae are failed supernovae (i.e., no O and Fe production).",
    "More parameter studies are shown in Figure 4",

    "The contribution to GCE from AGB stars (green dotted lines in Figure 5 ) can be seen mainly for C and N, and only slightly for Na, compared with the model that includes supernovae only (blue dashed lines).",
    "With failed SNe, our fiducial model (red solid lines in Figure 6 ) is in good agreement with observations of most of the major elements.",
    "Carbon—Half of carbon in the universe is produced by massive stars (>10 M ⊙ ), while the rest is mainly produced by low-mass AGB stars (1–4 M ⊙ ; K11 ).",

    "Zinc—Zn is one of the most important elements for the physics of core-collapse supernovae as 64,66–70Zn are enhanced in the deepest region of HNe with higher explosion energy and entropy (K06), and thus [Zn/Fe] is increased with multi-dimensional effects (dotted line in Figure 30).",
