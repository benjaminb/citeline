      "The expansion energy of a relativistic fireball can be reconverted into radiation upon interaction with an external medium, with time-scales of the order of seconds for Lorentz factors greater than or approximately equal to 1000.\n",

      "This mechanism operates in cosmological scenarios of gamma-ray bursts involving initial energies of about a percent of a stellar rest mass, producing photon energies and time-scales compatible with observed gamma-ray bursts.\n",
      "\tCosine distance to query: 0.4738\n",
      "Interaction with even very tenuous external matter efficiently reconverts the kinetic energy of a baryon-loaded relativistic fireball into high-energy photons, observable on time-scales similar to those of gamma-ray bursts.\n",
      "\tCosine distance to query: 0.4364\n",
      "The deceleration of a fireball in an external medium leads to the reconversion of bulk kinetic energy into thermal energy, which can be radiated away if cooling times are sufficiently short.\n",
      "\tCosine distance to query: 0.4098\n",
      "For a fireball with specific energy and external density parameters, the observed time-scale for the peak power reception is sensitive primarily to the Lorentz factor, scaling as the Lorentz factor to the power of -8/3.\n",
      "\tCosine distance to query: 0.4813\n",
      "The mechanism suggests that gamma-ray bursts could be explained by highly directed events, each involving energies well below 10^51 erg, due to the small solid angle from which the observed radiation comes.\n",
      "\tCosine distance to query: 0.4646\n",
      "The model addresses major difficulties in cosmological gamma-ray burst models, such as the recovery of expansion kinetic energy and the relevant burst time-scales, by utilizing the expansion dynamics of fireballs produced in events like neutron star binary mergers.\n",
