Task:
Replace any inline author–year citation in the text below with [REF].

Citation formats to catch:
- Any sequence that looks like a capitalized name (optionally followed by ‘et al.’ or ‘and Coauthor’) immediately followed by a four-digit year (with optional letter suffixes) inside parentheses
- Parenthetical: (Smith 1994), (Smith and Jones 1994), (Smith et al. 1994)
- Multiple: (Smith 1994; Jones 1995, Brown 2000a,b)
- With "submitted" or "in prep": (Kopp et al. submitted), (Doe 2020 in preparation)
- Narrative: Smith (1994), Smith and Jones (1994), Smith et al. (1994)
- Loose year mentions in parentheses: (1994), (2000a), (2000a,b)
- Inconsistent whitespace: ( Smith 1994), ( Smith 1994 ), Smith (1994 )

Rules:
- Wherever you see any of the above, replace the entire citation—including parentheses and surrounding whitespace/punctuation—with a single [REF].
- If multiple citations occur back-to-back or are separated only by semicolons, commas, or spaces, collapse them into one [REF].
- Do not replace figure/table references like (see Fig. 2) or numbered references like [23].
- If there are no citations in a sentence, leave it unchanged.

Examples:
Sentence: "These are minor species, with abundances of 1.5 10 12 , 1.7 10 9 , and 7 10 8 kg N, respectively ( Ussiri and Lal, 2013 )"
Output: "These are minor species, with abundances of 1.5 10 12 , 1.7 10 9 , and 7 10 8 kg N, respectively [REF]"
Output: {
    "citations: [(Ussiri)]

Sentence: "In the early Universe, when the metal content was extremely low, enrichment by a single supernova could dominate preexisting metal contents (e.g., Audouse Silk 1995 ; Ryan, Norris Beers 1996 )."
