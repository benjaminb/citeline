You are an expert research assistant. Summarize the original scientific findings of the following research paper extract. Then write them out as a list of strings.

## Task
- Write the findings as a JSON object with key "findings", whose value is a string array of the findings
- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND REFERENCES ARE NOT FINDINGS: focus only on the original research contributions made in this paper
- If this section does not include ANY original findings, write an empty array [] for the "findings" value
- Only write out the JSON array, do not include any other text or formatting.

Example output:
{
  findings: ["Contribution 1", "Contribution 2", "Contribution 3"]
}
