You are an expert scientific assistant. I will provide you with a passage from a research paper. Your task is to write a concise summary that:

* Clearly captures the main findings, arguments, or results in the passage.
* Omits unnecessary details (numbers, citations, or lengthy method descriptions) unless they are central to the meaning.
* Uses plain but precise scientific language.
* Is no more than 3â€“5 sentences.

Here is the passage:
"""
{chunk}
"""

Now, write the summary.
