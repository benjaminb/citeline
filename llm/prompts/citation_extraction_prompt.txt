"""
Sentence: "Like Caffau et al. (2008a) , we have similar findings."
Output: [["Caffau et al.", "2008"]]

Sentence: "Methods for mixing below the convection zone are well understood ( Brun, Turck-Chièze Zahn 1999 , Charbonnel Talon 2005 )."
Output: [["Brun, Turck-Chièze Zahn", "1999"], ["Charbonnel Talon", "2005"]]

Sentence: "Momentum balance gives an expression ( Fabian 1999 ; Di Matteo, Wilman Crawford 2002 ; King 2003 , 2005 )"
Output: [["Fabian", "1999"], ["Di Matteo, Wilman Crawford", "2002"], ["King", "2003"], ["King", "2005"]]

Sentence: "In the early Universe, when the metal content was extremely low, enrichment by a single supernova could dominate preexisting metal contents (e.g., Audouse Silk 1995 ; Ryan, Norris Beers 1996 )."
Output: [["Audouse Silk", "1995"], ["Ryan, Norris Beers", "1996"]]

Sentence: "Caffau and Brun (2009) made several imaging advances primarily to identify quasars"
Output: [["Caffau and Brun", "2009"]]

Sentence: "Turck-Chieze(2005) identified when metal content was extremely low"
Output: [["Turck-Chieze", "2005"]]

Sentence: "In work by Jones (2000a,b) it was demonstrated that dark matter detection can be elegantly detected."
Output: [["Jones", "2000a"], ["Jones", "2000b"]]

Sentence: "This is consistent with previous results (Pereira et al., in preparation)."
Output: []

Sentence: "More imaging showed significant expansion (Jones, Ryan, et al., submitted)"
