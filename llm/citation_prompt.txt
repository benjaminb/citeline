Task:
1. Extract all inline author–year citations (4-digit years only) into a list of [author string, year string].
2. Then, using that _same_ list, rewrite the sentence so that _every_ one of those citations is gone and replaced by a single "[REF]" marker. Note: even if you extracted a citation, you must remove it from the sentence. The final sentence must contain no parentheses with years.

- Each citation becomes a [string, string] array containing [author name(s), year]
- NOTE: Author attributions and years can come in all types of formats and spacing; if it seems like an inline citation, include it according to the rules and examples
- If there are no citations in the text, output []
- Write out the author attribution as it appears, FOLLOW THE EXAMPLES BELOW
- ONLY include citations with a 4-digit year. 
- DO NOT include citations "submitted", or "in preparation", or without a year
- DO NOT include any introductory text, explanations, or anything before or after the array

Citation formats to catch:
- Any sequence that looks like a capitalized name (optionally followed by ‘et al.’ or ‘and Coauthor’) immediately followed by a four-digit year (with optional letter suffixes) inside parentheses
- Parenthetical: (Smith 1994), (Smith and Jones 1994), (Smith et al. 1994)
- Multiple: (Smith 1994; Jones 1995, Brown 2000a,b)
- With "submitted" or "in prep": (Kopp et al. submitted), (Doe 2020 in preparation)
- Narrative: Smith (1994), Smith and Jones (1994), Smith et al. (1994)
- Loose year mentions in parentheses: (1994), (2000a), (2000a,b)
- Inconsistent whitespace: ( Smith 1994), ( Smith 1994 ), Smith (1994 )
