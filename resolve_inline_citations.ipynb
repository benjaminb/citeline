      "84: (101) In fact, Wetherill (1994) considers this question and suggests three ways in which this might occur. \n",
      "85: (102) The second fixes carbon to produce the simple organic formic acid, but is not entropically favorable. \n",

      "87: (103) Life on Earth appears to have an absolute requirement for liquid water ( Mazur 1980 , Horowitz 1986 ). \n",
      "88: (103) Europa is locked in a tidal resonance with the satellites Io and Ganymede, and spin-locked to Jupiter. \n",
      "89: (104) As the density of stars increases toward the center of the galaxy, so too does the stellar metallicity. \n",
      "90: (104) Nevertheless, the prebiotic origin of the RNA that populated the putative RNA world remains mysterious. \n",

      "99: (109) The resulting phylogenetic 10 map for a key part of the ribosome has come to be known as the “tree of life.” \n",
      "100: (109) In the previous section we recalled the coupled evolution of terrestrial life and its planetary environment. \n",
      "101: (110) Key parameters in defining the zone include metallicity, the nearby frequency of supernovae, and stellar age. \n",
      "102: (111) For if the universe were infinitely old, life could be infinitely old, and no origin would need to be posited. \n",
      "103: (111) The third couples the first two reactions to provide an entropically favored way to produce organic molecules. \n",

      "106: (112) The origin of life remains one of the most fundamental questions in astrobiology, and indeed in all of science. \n",
      "107: (113) However, the elucidation of the organic chemistry of Saturn's moon Titan will shed light on these possibilities. \n",
      "108: (113) Estimates of the capability of the mission indicate that Earth-like planets could be detected up to 45 lyr away. \n",
      "109: (113) This is all the more so as human intelligence is now strongly shaping the terrestrial environment and biosphere. \n",
      "110: (113) Even the completion of a decade's searching with the ATA, however, will sample 10 -5 of the stars in our Galaxy. \n",
      "111: (114) Objects in the heavens, however, clearly move in circles about the Earth, i.e., about the center of the universe. \n",
      "112: (114) How likely is it that that the probability of evolving a technical civilization is greater than ∼10 -11 per star? \n",
      "113: (114) Synthesis and sequencing productivity is now increasing as fast or faster than Moore's Law ( upwards triangles ). \n",
      "114: (115) Lineweaver, Fenner Gibson (2004) find that perhaps 10% of the stars that have formed in the Galaxy are in the GHZ. \n",
      "115: (115) Animals with EQ > 1 are brainier than expected; those with EQ 1 are less brainy than expected for their body size. \n",
      "116: (116) The word astrobiology was used by the astronomer Otto Struve (1955) , and was adopted by NASA in 1995 ( NAI 2004 ). \n",
      "117: (116) They therefore obviously obey a different physical law—circular (and therefore eternal) motion, rather than linear. \n",
      "118: (116) Over a decade, Project Phoenix devoted about 460 days of observing time searching the nearest ∼10 3 Sun-like stars. \n",
      "119: (116) In fact, there is one good such measure that is widely used—the concept of encephalization ( Jerison 1955 , 1973 ). \n",
      "120: (117) Had this view of the universe turned out to be correct, astrobiology would be simply impossible, obviously mistaken. \n",
      "121: (117) With the process of HGT acting on and between populations, the view of descent from a common ancestor is challenged. \n",
      "122: (117) The best-known example of a Fermi problem was the question “how many piano tuners are there in the city of Chicago?” \n",
      "123: (118) If astrobiology is the study of the living universe, it is important to inquire into what we mean by the word living. \n",
      "124: (119) Great apes come in much lower, with a mean around 1.9, about the same as that of the human ancestor Australopithecus . \n",
      "125: (120) Especially intriguing is the pulsar timing evidence for a planet in the M4 globular cluster ( Sigurdsson et al. 2003 ). \n",
      "126: (120) At constant T and pressure, ΔG 0 for the system of interest corresponds to ΔS > 0 for the system plus its surroundings. \n",
      "127: (120) The physics, chemistry, possible biology and future exploration of Europa have been reviewed by Chyba Phillips (2005) . \n",
      "128: (121) At its upper end we might imagine that L could be as long as a G-class star lifetime (and perhaps longer), ∼10 10 years. \n",
      "129: (122) Ultimately, however, life produces heat and other wastes that more than compensate for the localized decrease in entropy. \n",
      "130: (122) The resulting change in the global stability of water ice would have caused glaciation reaching down to 30°–35° latitude. \n",
      "131: (122) The only cosmochemically plausible material with this density is water, consistent with spectroscopy of Europa's surface. \n",
      "132: (123) In this sense astrobiology merely confronts what is a familiar, even commonplace situation in many of its sister sciences. \n",
      "133: (123) The primary goal of these missions is the direct detection and characterization of Earth-like planets around nearby stars. \n",
      "134: (123) As a result, biologically useful chemical gradients would also be reduced and life might be less prolific on such a world. \n",
      "135: (123) Structures of similar age and morphology are also seen in the ∼3.0 Gya rocks of Steep Rock, Ontario ( Wilks Nisbet 1985 ). \n",
      "136: (123) As discussed previously with respect to the anthropic principle, our strong observer bias calls such claims into question. \n",
      "137: (124) For comparison, the rate at which a single molecule of DNA polymerase III in the bacterium E. coli replicates DNA is shown. \n",
      "138: (125) 3 After removing observational bias, they find that the probability of finding a 18 M Jup planet increases with metallicity. \n",
      "139: (126) For example, the biology package experiments on the Viking spacecraft landers all searched for signs of microbial metabolism. \n",
      "140: (126) In the United States, NASA implements this policy with advice from the Space Sciences Board of the National Research Council. \n",
      "141: (128) This in turn implies that the Earth must be spherical (consistent with observation) and centered on the center of the universe. \n",
      "142: (128) The so-called anthropic principle ( Carter 1974 , Barrow Tipler 1986 ) is sometimes invoked to illuminate this remarkable fact. \n",
      "143: (128) Many geologically young features observed on the martian surface may have been caused by changes in solar insolation over time. \n",
      "144: (128) Touma's (2000) simulations of the Earth–Moon system take Earth's initial rotation period to be 5.0 hr, with the Moon at 3.5 R⊕. \n",
      "145: (129) That in turn must mean that they are not made of the four terrestrial elements, but rather of a fifth element, the quintessence. \n",
      "146: (129) The “design hypothesis” accounts for fine-tuning on the basis of purposeful design ( Swineburne 1990 , Gonzalez Richards 2004 ). \n",
      "147: (129) The possibility of life on contemporary Mars suggests that such regulation can be overwhelmed by planetary geological evolution. \n",
      "148: (129) Therefore, the argument would have run, because the timescale for mountain building cannot be ≪τ ⊙ , it must typically be ≫τ ⊙ . \n",
      "149: (130) Though peptides have not yet been synthesized, earlier results utilizing sulfur (thiols) give reason for optimism ( Weber 1998 ). \n",
      "150: (131) In the near future (2009–2015), rovers with ranges of km per day should be deployed and a sample return mission may be undertaken. \n",
      "151: (132) Indeed, water has been called the universal solvent because of its ability to form hydrogen bonds with polar solutes ( Blum 1962 ). \n",
      "152: (132) However, much experimental work remains to be done to test the claims of this scheme ( de Duve Miller 1991 , Chyba McDonald 1995 ). \n",
      "153: (132) Such vesicles, or cells, are important for maintaining useful energy gradients and for concentrating biologically useful compounds. \n",
      "154: (132) Indeed, Crutzen (2002) defines our current geological period as the “anthropocene,” so strong and pervasive are humanity's effects. \n",
      "155: (133) Due to the cold temperatures (∼94 K) and lack of liquid water, it is not generally believed to be an environment conducive for life. \n",
      "156: (135) One could also relax the requirements for life as we know it by considering the prospects for life based on an atom other than carbon. \n",
      "157: (135) This observation has been used ( Ward Brownlee 2000 , Gonzalez Richards 2004 ) as evidence for how contingent Earth's habitability is. \n",
      "158: (136) Earlier, Struve (1955) had concluded that the time was “probably not yet ripe” to recognize a new astronomical discipline by this name. \n",
      "159: (136) The long stellar lifetimes, stability, and abundance of such stars make them especially intriguing from the standpoint of astrobiology. \n",
      "160: (136) Most of this heating is due to radioactive decay, but 25–30% is heating leftover from terrestrial accretion ( Turcotte Schubert 1982 ). \n",
      "161: (138) It once seemed possible that a steady-state model would provide an accurate description of the universe ( Bondi Gold 1948 , Hoyle 1948 ). \n",
      "162: (138) It is possible that Mars may have stabilized near the triple point of water because of a different CO 2 feedback mechanism ( Kahn 1985 ). \n",
      "163: (138) Furthermore, vesicle formation has been shown to occur using organics found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites ( Deamer Pashley 1989 ). \n",
      "164: (138) The tremendous task remains to see how proto-cellular structures coupled with genetic material can then lead to self-replicating systems. \n",
      "165: (138) This region of the DNA would be highly conserved, because the ribosome is the crucial molecule for the synthesis of proteins in the cell. \n",
      "166: (139) But the asteroid belt likely exists because Jupiter's gravitational stirring prevented the accretion of those objects into a single world. \n",
      "167: (140) Nevertheless, some have argued that a meta approach to genomic analysis may still be able to yield the correct outline of the tree of life. \n",
      "168: (140) One line of evidence that could prove compelling, however, is that of the discrete cellular compartmentalization of the mineralized carbon. \n",
      "169: (141) Obviously high-mass stars provide dramatically shorter periods of time during which a planetary environment might permit the origin of life. \n",
      "170: (141) The paradox obviously does not hold in a strict logical sense, as each of its assertions is at best a claim of probability ( Freitas 1985 ). \n",
      "171: (142) 1. THE SCIENCE OF ASTROBIOLOGY The NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI) defines astrobiology as “the study of the living universe” ( NAI 2004 ). \n",
      "172: (142) This was not always held to be the case; in particular, Aristotle ( De Caelo ) posited a radical dichotomy between the heavens and the Earth. \n",
      "173: (142) Following the Kepler and COROT missions will be the NASA Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF; JPL 2005 ) and the ESA Darwin mission ( ESA 2005b ). \n",
      "174: (142) Some Earth-crossing objects are thought to be burned-out short-period comets, but most are likely asteroids originating in the asteroid belt. \n",

      "331: (197) The hypothesis of interstellar microbial transfer ( Arrhenius 1903 ), more quaintly known as “panspermia,” may therefore play a more fundamental role in a steady-state than in a big-bang universe. \n",

      "362: (207) However, the hydrogen content of the early atmosphere remains uncertain ( Tian et al. 2005 ), so it is wisest to consider a range of atmospheric models and their differing consequences ( Chyba Sagan 1992 ). \n",
      "363: (207) Perhaps the most disturbing proposed evidence against an ancient biosignature in the Akilia rocks is the claim that the apatite crystals do not, in fact, contain graphite inclusions ( Lepland et al. 2005 ). \n",
      "364: (208) The exploration of Titan, and in particular the chemical analyses by the Huygens probe ( ESA 2005a ), may shed light on the plausibility of nonpolar solvents as the basis for an alternative nonpolar biology. \n",

      "366: (209) That is, they are the result of high temperature fluids interacting with iron-rich material, and not the result of iron precipitation and sedimentation as is often associated with early microbial communities. \n",
      "367: (210) Clark et al. note that supernovae preferentially occur in more dense regions of the galaxy, and in particular they describe a “supernovae zone” trailing behind the compression lane of the galactic spiral arms. \n",
      "368: (211) The principle's “strong” version ( Carter 1974 ) states that “the Universe (and hence the fundamental parameters on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage.” \n",
      "369: (211) Although there are variations in the exact definition, we use Jerison's (1973) definition, e.g., EQ 0.67 = (brain weight)/[ 0.12 (body weight) 0.67 ], where the subscript designates the exponent of body weight. \n",
      "370: (212) Ideally, these investigations would be conducted in the context of an agreed and precise understanding of the nature of life, yet as we have just seen, such an account is, for fundamental reasons, not available. \n",
      "371: (212) Bottoms Up The ‘primordial soup’ theory has dominated scientific opinion since Oparin (1924) and Haldane (1929) , and especially since the experimental work of Miller and Urey ( Miller 1953 , Miller Urey 1959 ). \n",
      "372: (212) Symbioses at the cellular level, such as the endosymbiotic incorporation of cyanobacteria into a functional chloroplast or proteobacteria into mitochondria, were major evolutionary innovations ( Margulis 1999 ). \n",
      "373: (213) Despite our lack of scientific understanding of the origin of life, it is clear that the universe appears remarkably “fine-tuned” for life as we know it ( Henderson 1913 , Blum 1962 , Carter 1974 , Leslie 1996 ). \n",
      "374: (213) The question of whether other planets like Earth exist has been asked literally for millennia, at least since Aristotle ( De Caelo 276 a30 –276 b24 ), though he had principled reasons to rule out the possibility. \n",
      "375: (213) The Large Number Argument It may seem intuitive that in a Galaxy of hundreds of billions of stars, it would be extraordinary for Earth to host the only intelligent species or even the only technical civilization. \n",
      "376: (214) It is extraordinary that within a few years humanity will no longer have to grope at this question, but instead will know the statistics of other Earths (if any) orbiting within the habitable zones of other stars. \n",
      "377: (214) The discovery of key biomarker molecules, such as the terpanoids, hopanes, and steranes 13 derived from cellular and membrane lipids, can provide strong evidence for the past presence of life in ancient sediments. \n",
      "378: (215) The idea that there is a “belt of life” in the Galaxy, an annulus within which intelligent life is most likely to be found, was introduced by Marochnik Mukhin (1986) in 1981, then expanded by Balázs (1986 , 1988) . \n",
      "379: (215) Such biomarkers have been used to argue for the advent of cyanobacteria, and therefore oxgenic photosynthesis, by 2.5 Gya and for the emergence of eukaryotes at 2.7 Gya ( Brocks et al. 1999 , Summons et al. 1999 ). \n",
      "380: (215) In the face of the uncertainties the Drake equation illuminates, the large-numbers argument cannot in itself resolve questions about the frequency of either communicable civilizations or intelligence in the galaxy. \n",
      "381: (215) (Indeed, biological convergence is much more common than the famous examples like sight and flight alone suggest; Conway Morris (2003) includes a “convergences index” that references about 400 evolutionary examples.\n",
      "382: (216) There is therefore a whiff of Aristotelianism in recent cosmological discoveries, but this does not change the fact that we live in a universe that appears compatible with life over vast stretches of space and time. \n",
      "383: (217) Rather, to answer the question “what is life?” we require not a definition but a scientific theory, analogous to the theory of molecules that permits one to give an unambiguous answer to the question “what is water?” \n",
      "384: (217) Some important experimental progress along these lines was demonstrated (e.g., Oró 1961 ), but synthesizing proteins and nucleic acids under realistic prebiotic conditions remains challenging ( Chyba McDonald 1995 ). \n",
      "385: (217) At the level of the complete cell, efforts are now underway to strip down a microbial genome to reveal the minimal set of genes necessary for complete cellular functionality ( Hutchison et al. 1999 , Marshall 2002 ). \n",
      "386: (217) Such regions among different organisms can be intercompared, DNA base by base, and the number of differences between two DNA sequences can be used to gauge the “evolutionary distance” between organisms ( Pace 1997 ). \n",
      "387: (218) Weber (2000) also begins with metabolism as a motivating premise for the emergence of life, but he argues for sugars as the optimal, most energetically useful substrate from which to synthesize more complex compounds. \n",
      "388: (218) HGT—also referred to as lateral gene transfer in the case of intraspecies events—involves the transfer of nucleotide strands with lengths of 10 2 –10 4 base pairs from one organism to another ( Lawrence Ochman 1998 ). \n",
      "389: (219) Had a steady-state model turned out to be correct, astrobiology would not be challenged but there would be no intellectual requirement to explain the origin of life, now viewed as one of astrobiology's great questions. \n",
      "390: (219) Lineweaver et al. also argue that high metallicities will limit the habitability of a star because such high metallicities promote the formation of gas giants that spiral inward and destroy any habitable rocky planets. \n",
      "391: (219) It now seems clear that there is a “deep, hot biosphere” ( Gold 1992 ) in Earth's subsurface, some components of which may be entirely independent of surface conditions ( Chapelle et al. 2002 ), including solar energy. \n",
      "392: (219) In the labs of both Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman during the 1980s, it was discovered that some sequences of RNA had the ability both to self-splice and to catalyze protein synthesis ( Altman et al. 1989 , Cech 1993 ). \n",
      "393: (219) It is too glib to claim that if the origin of life took place on Earth immediately after the end of the heavy bombardment, then the origin of life must be “easy,” so that the prospects for life elsewhere are increased. \n",
      "394: (220) Gravity measurements with the Galileo spacecraft show that Europa is an internally differentiated rocky body with a surface layer of material of density 1000 kg m -3 between 80 and 170 km thick ( Anderson et al. 1998 ). \n",
      "395: (221) In the usual view, a stabilizing feedback driven by plate tectonics on Earth has allowed CO 2 and H 2 O on Earth to maintain greenhouse heating in just the range to permit surface oceans to exist through geological time. \n",
      "396: (221) The resulting pyrite (FeS 2 ) and simple organic compounds (here, formic acid) could then be bound electrostatically by the attraction of the positively charged pyrite surface to the negatively charged organic compounds. \n",
      "397: (224) In this respect astrobiology is now understood more broadly than when the term was first coined, apparently by Laurence Lafleur (1941) , who defined it as “the consideration of life in the universe elsewhere than on earth.” \n",
      "398: (225) A biochemistry employing liquid ammonia at atmospheric pressure would proceed far more slowly than terrestrial biochemistry because of the typical Arrhenius exponential dependence of chemical reaction rates with temperature. \n",
      "399: (227) Wetherill (1994) showed that solar systems otherwise like our own, but lacking a Jupiter-size world, could subject their interior Earths to a cometary impact flux ∼10 3 times larger than that which would otherwise be the case. \n",
      "400: (227) Recent work demonstrating facile, nonbiological synthesis of complex, filamentous silica-carbonate structures blurs the line segregating biogenic morphologies from inorganically produced structures ( Garcia-Ruiz et al. 2003 ). \n",
      "401: (228) Indeed, approaching a hundred carbon-based (mostly organic 2 ) molecules have been identified in the interstellar medium ( Ehrenfreund et al. 2002 ), whereas no comparable suite of varied silicon-based molecules has been found. \n",
      "402: (228) This work has also been extended to simulated interstellar conditions, demonstrating that primitive membrane structures can form from amphiphilic molecules in UV-irradiated interstellar/precometary ices ( Dworkin et al. 2001 ). \n",
      "403: (228) Though significant progress has been made in deriving the 16S rRNA tree ( Pace 1997 ), large uncertainties remain, in part because of evidence for widespread horizontal gene transfer (HGT) ( Gogarten, Doolittle Lawrence 2002 ). \n",
      "404: (229) This model of mineral surface catalysis is also attractive in principle because as the reactions increase in complexity, lipid-like compounds could form and eventually a membrane or proto-cellular structure could be synthesized. \n",
      "405: (229) Throughout discussions of lessons learned from DNA phylogenies, it is important to remember the limitations of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique used to replicate and amplify the DNA needed for phylogenetic analysis. \n",
      "406: (229) It is broadly agreed that robust and abundant fossil evidence is present in ∼3 Gya rocks, that less certain fossil evidence exists in 3.5 Gya rocks, and that substantially controversial isotopic evidence exists in 3.8 Gya rocks. \n",
      "407: (229) However, increasingly ancient rocks generally make such tests increasingly difficult to perform, and the 3.5 Gya Warawoona rocks have in particular been too metamorphosed to permit the survival of such biomarkers ( Knoll 2003 ). \n",
      "408: (230) Indeed, much of the most important and exciting research in astronomy and physics is concerned exactly with the study of objects or phenomena whose existence has not been demonstrated—and that may, in fact, turn out not to exist. \n",
      "409: (230) Less analogously to life on Earth, speculation for alternative biological sources of energy may encompass the capture of energy from electromagnetic fields, kinetic energy, gravity, or other sources ( Schulze-Makuch Irwin 2004 ). \n",
      "410: (231) If an organism does not have these shared sequences it will go undiscovered until our genomic knowledge expands to include “primer” DNA sequences that will find such organisms—assuming, of course, that they have DNA to begin with. \n",
      "411: (232) If exobiology (or astrobiology) were understood to mean solely the study of extraterrestrial life—which it is not—Simpson's criticism would remain strictly true but might nevertheless seem bizarre to many astronomers or physicists. \n",
      "412: (232) These discoveries about life on Earth inform our thinking about the prospects for life elsewhere, making subsurface environments on Mars or subsurface-ocean-bearing moons like Europa seem more plausible ( Sagan 1996 , Chyba 1997 ). \n",
      "413: (233) 5. THE GALACTIC HABITABLE ZONE The laws and physical constant values of the universe may be compatible with intelligent life, but it could still be that many venues potentially habitable by complex life have turned out not to be so. \n",
      "414: (234) For the time being, astrobiologists, like other biologists, are in a position analogous to that of Leonardo in trying to make sense of the seemingly changing nature of water before anyone understood hydrogen, oxygen, or atomic bonds. \n",
      "415: (234) Ribozyme, or RNA enzyme, 8 molecules are capable of catalytic activity as well as information storage, implying a solution to the chicken-or-egg puzzle that had long haunted work in origins ( Dyson 1985 )—proteins first or DNA first? \n",
      "416: (234) As emphasized by Woese (1998) , the primary branches of the universal tree of life reflect “the common history of central components of the ribosome, components of the transcription apparatus, and a few other genes. But that is all.” \n",
      "417: (235) A combination of evidence based on microfossils, stromatolites, 11 and isotopic fractionation have led some to argue that life on Earth may have been well established by 3.8–3.5 Gya ( Schopf 1993 , Mojzsis et al. 1996 , Rosing 1999 ). \n",
      "418: (235) Various objections to this and related arguments may be found in the literature ( Bostrom 2002 ), but perhaps the one most subject to scientific investigation is Livio's (1999) approach of questioning the independence of τ l and τ ⊙ . \n",
      "419: (236) Most important among these was the failure of the Viking gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GCMS) to find organic molecules to its limits of detection with stepwise heating of martian soil samples up to 500°C ( Biemann et al. 1977 ). \n",
      "420: (237) Krasnopolsky, Maillard Owen (2004) view methanogenesis by oases of living subterranean organisms as a plausible explanation, though the less extraordinary hypothesis of abiogenic volcanic or hydrothermal sources cannot now be ruled out. \n",
      "421: (238) TPF-I will be a mid-infrared observatory with four formation-flying 3.5 m mirrors that will use nulling intereferometry (as will Darwin) for investigating the atmospheric chemistry and possible chemical biosignatures on detected planets. \n",
      "422: (239) But it should be sufficient for a biochemistry to catalyze reactions substantially faster than they occur in the environment—relative rates are more important than absolute rates, provided extrinsic environmental factors do not intervene. \n",
      "423: (239) In particular, because of this selection effect we cannot validly apply the Copernican principle (the assumption that Earth occupies no privileged place in the universe) to conclude either that other life or other intelligent life exists. \n",
      "424: (239) Europa Europa is the most astrobiologically interesting site in our solar system besides Mars, because it likely harbors a contemporary ocean of liquid water of mass about twice that of Earth's oceans beneath an ice shell ∼10–30 km thick. \n",
      "425: (239) Indeed, it has been declared that this process is responsible for creating “mayhem at the root” of our tree of life ( Doolittle 1999 ), and the “last common ancestor” may have been a promiscuously gene-exchanging community ( Woese 1998 ). \n",
      "426: (242) As one simplified example, consider the three reactions: The first of these reactions is entropically favorable (ΔG 0 for the system at constant pressure and temperature, so ΔS > 0 for the system plus surroundings), but produces no organics. \n",
      "427: (242) The point at which major branches converge represents the last common ancestor for those two branches; thus the organisms located closest to the most basal branches of the tree might be representative of the most ancient life forms on Earth. \n",
      "428: (245) There is now known to be an impressive array of compounds, mostly not organic, that microscopic organisms use as fuels, and a comparable number, mostly not involving molecular oxygen, that microscopic organisms use as oxidants ( Nealson 1997 ). \n",
      "429: (245) Obviously this equation does not have the status of an equation like that of the ideal gas law, which posits a relationship among the pressure, volume, and temperature of gases in the physical world and so is subject to potential falsification. \n",
      "430: (246) Although they do find δ 13 C values 12 of –30‰ to –26‰, compatible with biogenic fractionation of the carbon, they argue that such fractionation could also occur when volcanic CO 2 interacts with high-temperature (250–350°C) hydrothermal fluids. \n",
      "431: (247) In this picture, there is nothing surprising about finding ourselves within one of the large number of universes (which nevertheless may represent a tiny fraction of the total) in which conditions permissive of the evolution of intelligence hold. \n",
      "432: (248) Surface conditions on Titan permit the nonpolar molecules methane (CH 4 ) and ethane (C 2 H 6 ) to exist as liquids ( Lunine, Stevenson Yung 1983 ), and Titan appears to have a meteorological cycle based on methane ( Griffith, Hall Geballe 2000 ). \n",
      "433: (248) The south polar region of Titan is currently experiencing heavy cloud activity and, as Saturn continues along its orbit, the Cassini spacecraft will monitor changes during Titan-flybys it will make roughly monthly for the next three or more years. \n",
      "434: (248) In particular, he has demonstrated that under ambient, room temperature and pressure conditions he can create a “one-pot” reaction capable of synthesizing sugars from formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde, and then amino acids from the resulting sugars. \n",
      "435: (248) There is strong evidence that EQ among primates correlates with innovatory behaviors, social learning, and tool use ( Reader Laland 2002 ; Lefebvre, Reader Sol 2004 ); among birds it correlates with behavioral flexibility ( Lefebvre et al. 1997 ). \n",
      "436: (249) Graphite in the 3.8 Gya highly metamorphosed sedimentary rocks (metasediments) of Western Greenland was found to have an isotopic signature of δ 13 C ≈ −28‰, seemingly indicative of biological activity early in Earth's history ( Schidlowski 1988 ). \n",
      "437: (250) For comparison, modern humans and their tool-using ancestors Homo erectus and the earlier Homo habilis have , and 4.3, respectively; the even earlier Australopithecus had an EQ 0.67 about that of the mean for modern apes, around 1.9 ( Marino 1996 ). \n",
      "438: (251) Moreover, as conditions on early Earth were further studied, the early atmosphere came to be viewed as rich in CO 2 rather than in the hydrogen-rich (reducing) compounds that Miller and Urey used in their initial experiments ( Kasting Catling 2003 ). \n",
      "439: (252) The resonance forces an orbital eccentricity that leads to tidal flexing and enough internal energy dissipation to maintain most of this ice layer as liquid water ( Cassen, Reynolds Peale 1979 , 1980 ; Ojakangas Stevenson 1989 ; Chyba Phillips 2005 ). \n",
      "440: (252) Carbonate deposits in ∼3 Gya South African sedimentary rocks show well-preserved stromatolites that match well with similar, known biogenic structures seen in much younger rocks and even in modern aqueous sedimentary environments ( Beukes Lowe 1989 ). \n",
      "441: (252) Greatly condensed, the idea of his argument is that we expect there to be no correlation between the lifetime τ ⊙ of a main-sequence star like our Sun, and the timescale τ l for biological evolution, say to the point of our own technical intelligence. \n",
      "442: (253) This is nowhere more apparent than in the oxygenation of the atmosphere by photosynthesizing organisms, though this oxygen source also had to be mated to a geological sequestration of organic carbon (for reviews see Kasting Catling 2003 , Knoll 2003 ). \n",
      "443: (253) After all, there was no obvious connection between the rapidity of mountain building and the solar lifetime, and because mountains could not have formed during Earth's magma ocean, the timescale for mountain building could not be less than ∼10 8 years. \n",
      "444: (254) But centuries later, once there was a good general theory of atoms and molecules, water could be unambiguously identified as H 2 O. A precise answer to the question “what is water?” is possible only when situated within an appropriate scientific theory. \n",
      "445: (255) If the triumph of the Newtonian worldview made the universe safe for astrobiology, the triumph of big-bang cosmology ( Weinberg 1983 , Bennett 2005 ; but see Narlikar Padmanabhan 2001 ) requires that universe to have provided at least one origin of life. \n",
      "446: (256) Even planets that have been ejected from their parent star and are now traveling through interstellar space could still be habitable for subsurface microscopic life provided sufficient geothermal heating to permit liquid water at depth ( Stevenson 1999 ). \n",
      "447: (256) In particular, the drive to identify ways in which Earth is special carries dangers when analysts, with good post hoc knowledge, pick the exact element of a complicated system that, if somehow removed, would have especially negative consequences for life. \n",
      "448: (258) Venus, too close to the Sun, lost its H 2 O owing to a moist or even runaway greenhouse, whereas Mars, too small to maintain substantial geological activity over the age of the solar system, saw its CO 2 atmosphere collapse and is now a freeze-dried desert. \n",
      "449: (260) They argue that the idea that one can answer the question “what is life?” by defining life is mistaken, resting on confusions about the nature of definition and its ability to answer fundamental questions about the natural world ( Cleland Chyba 2002 , 2005 ). \n",
      "450: (260) In bulk, however, these filaments are found to be randomly oriented and irregularly distributed, unlike some Proterozoic (2500 Mya to 543 Mya) and modern cyanobacterial assemblages, although randomly oriented filament in modern microbial mats are not unknown. \n",
      "451: (261) For the technique to work, the DNA of the unknown target organism—many of which have never been cultured in the laboratory, and may be known only through their 16S DNA sequences—must have at least some small shared sequences in common with known DNA sequences. \n",
      "452: (262) This requirement is reflected, for example, in the slogan “follow the water,” adopted by NASA's Mars exploration program ( NASA JPL 2004 ) as its strategy for answering what it calls the “defining question for Mars exploration” of whether there is life on Mars. \n",
      "453: (262) The fact that the microbe Deinococcus radiodurans has been found to contain plant genes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been found to contain at least eight human genes confounds attempts to reconstruct evolutionary history based on genomes ( Pennisi 1999 ). \n",
      "454: (262) 11. EVOLUTION OF INTELLIGENCE To study the evolution of intelligence quantitatively, one needs a reproducible measurement that correlates with what is meant by intelligence, and that can be employed with the fossil record as well as with contemporary organisms. \n",
      "455: (263) 7. THE ORIGIN OF LIFE Throughout our discussion of planetary habitability, we have so far failed to emphasize that determining an environment to be habitable for modern microorganisms does not mean that the origin of life could have occurred in that environment. \n",
      "456: (263) 9. COUPLED EVOLUTION OF LIFE AND ITS PLANETARY ENVIRONMENT For the first ∼3 Gyr after the emergence of life on Earth, biological systems consisted of single-celled microbes, although macroscopic consortia such as mats or stromatolites appear to have been common. \n",
      "457: (264) For example, if the evidence for life at 3.8 Gya were compelling, that would mean that the timescale for the origin of life could be as short as ∼10 8 years or less, whereas if life did not originate until 3.45 Gya or 3.1 Gya, that timescale might be ∼10 9 years. \n",
      "458: (264) 10. INTELLIGENCE IN THE UNIVERSE Unless one takes the view that intelligence is independent of natural selection, the study of the evolution and prevalence of intelligence (and technical intelligence) on Earth and elsewhere is a natural component of astrobiology. \n",
      "459: (265) Although it now appears that the implications of these results for the absence of martian microbes may be weaker than they initially seemed ( Benner et al. 2000 , Glavin et al. 2001 ), at the time the conclusion seemed powerful: no organic molecules means no life. \n",
      "460: (265) Just as studies of microscopic life on Earth inform thinking about the prospects for microorganisms elsewhere, so should rigorous exploration of the evolution of intelligence on Earth inform astrobiologists' thinking about the prospects for intelligence elsewhere. \n",
      "461: (267) This arguably tautologous statement ( Leslie 1996 ) is useful if it reminds us that in our current position of occupying the only locale in the universe known to harbor life (and, a fortiori, intelligent life), we are subject to severe observation selection effects. \n",
      "462: (268) Lazcano Miller (1994) have argued on the basis of prebiotic chemistry that the origin of life on Earth must have taken less than ∼10 Myr, but because we do not understand the steps leading to the RNA world, such estimates cannot be rigorously defended ( Orgel 1998 ). \n",
      "463: (268) These results are those of only a nascent research program, but they emphasize that there are reproducible, quantitative methods that can now be applied to begin to address long-standing questions about the likelihood of the evolution of intelligence in the universe. \n",
      "464: (269) Coupling the accumulation of metals in the Milky Way Galaxy with sterilizing supernovae explosions and taking a 4±1 Gyr timescale for the evolution of complex life, Lineweaver, Fenner Gibson (2004) find an annular GHZ between 7 and 9 kpc from the center of the galaxy. \n",
      "465: (270) But then it must be generally true that τ l ≫ τ ⊙ , which in turn means that human civilization evolved in an exceptionally short period of time compared to the average, an event perhaps so unlikely that other civilizations might well not exist elsewhere in the galaxy. \n",
      "466: (271) Either it captures light, or it uses chemical energy—either by respiration [combining a fuel (an electron donor) with an oxidant (an electron acceptor)], or through fermentation (in which organics serve as both the primary electron donor and ultimate electron acceptor). \n",
      "467: (274) For this reason, searches for life within our solar system commonly retreat from a search for life to a search for “life as we know it,” meaning life based on liquid water, a suite of so-called “biogenic” elements (most famously carbon), and a usable source of free energy. \n",
      "468: (274) No variation in this frequency distribution was found when planets of mass 20 M Jup > M > 10 M Jup were compared to those of mass 10 M Jup and no change was found when comparing single planet systems to multiple planet systems or when considering planets in binary systems. \n",
      "469: (278) Whether the Copernican program will be extended into the biological realm and it will be discovered that we live in a “biological universe” ( Dick 1996 ) or, at the other extreme, whether life will turn out to be unique to Earth, remains a question for empirical investigation. \n",
      "470: (278) Changes in the albedo of layered deposits in the north polar ice cap, revealed by the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor, have been statistically matched to variations in polar temperature resulting from obliquity and eccentricity changes over time ( Laskar, Levrard Mustard 2002 ). \n",
      "471: (279) In extraterrestrial environments where sunlight is not readily available (such as in the ice-covered ocean of Jupiter's moon Europa), biological speculation focuses on ways independent of sunlight to produce biologically useful electron donors and acceptors ( Chyba Hand 2001 ). \n",
      "472: (280) In a spectroscopic analysis of over 80 stars so far known to host planets, Santos et al. (2003) find that the average metallicity is 0.24 dex greater than that of dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood, i.e., the Fe/H abundance is nearly twice as high in the planet-hosting stars. \n",
      "473: (280) Gaidos, Nealson Kirschvink (1999) have emphasized the difficulty of identifying sources of chemical disequilibrium on an ice-covered world whose ocean lacks access to the Sun and therefore photosynthesis, and the corresponding difficulty of maintaining a large biomass on Europa. \n",
      "474: (281) Although there were rival cosmologies to those of Aristotle, even in the Greek world ( Dreyer 1953 ), it was not until Newton (with anticipation by Descartes and Hooke) that it was demonstrated that the same laws of physics apply to the heavens as well as the Earth ( Kuhn 1957 ). \n",
      "475: (281) Stromatolites have been found in 3.5 Gya rocks, but modeling work has shown that such complex sedimentary structures could also potentially be produced abiogenically ( Grotzinger Rothman 1996 ), and it is difficult to be sure whether these are of biological origin ( Knoll 2003 ). \n",
      "476: (284) Wächtershäuser (1988 , 1990) proposed a scheme based on the reaction of aqueous CO 2 with FeS and H 2 S. Reactions leading to the formation of prebiotically interesting compounds such as formic acid are energetically favorable, as indicated by a negative change in Gibbs free energy. \n",
      "477: (285) In Book III of The Principia , Newton (1686) demonstrated that the same inverse-square law of gravitation that explained the acceleration of falling objects and projectile motion on Earth also explained the elliptical motion of planets around the Sun, or that of moons around planets. \n",
      "478: (286) An “RNA world” where RNA molecules performed the functions of both present-day proteins (e.g., acting as enzymes to catalyze reactions) and DNA (acting to store genetic information) now seems a likely evolutionary predecessor to our more specialized DNA-protein world ( Gilbert 1986 ). \n",
      "479: (287) There is an annular zone in our solar system, somewhat misleadingly called the habitable zone (HZ), that seems particularly welcoming to life because it spans those heliocentric distances where an Earth-size world would be able to maintain surface liquid water ( Kasting Catling 2003 ). \n",
      "480: (287) Whereas on Earth Milankovitch-driven obliquity and eccentricity variations run through only ∼2.5° and from 0.01 to 0.05, respectively, Mars is thought to have experienced over the past 10 Myr variations in obliquity from 13° to 47° and in eccentricity from 0.00 to 0.13 ( Howard 2002 ). \n",
      "481: (287) Even if Europa somehow formed devoid of biogenic elements, cometary collisions over the history of the solar system should have delivered sufficient quantities of these elements, despite Europa's low surface gravity, to provide the raw materials for a biosphere ( Pierazzo Chyba 2001 ). \n",
      "482: (287) Over the past decade, these lines of evidence have become increasingly controversial ( Brasier et al. 2002 ; van Zuilen, Lepland Arrhenius 2002 ), so we emphasize them in this review, working backward in time toward increasingly controversial evidence for the presence of life on Earth. \n",
      "483: (290) The lipids from which vesicle membranes are formed would have been prebiotically available on early Earth ( Hargreaves, Mulvihill Deamer 1977 ; Deamer Oró 1980 ) and encapsulation of peptides and nucleic acids was likely a critical step toward living systems ( Segre, Deamer Lancet 2001 ). \n",
      "484: (291) Treating intelligence as a property of the biological universe that can be quantitatively investigated—even though, as with life itself, we do not yet know if it is unique to Earth, rare, or common in the Galaxy—should allow us to move beyond polemics and adapt our thinking to actual data. \n",
      "485: (292) A simple angular momentum conservation calculation shows that if one tidally evolves the lunar orbit back in time from its current position at 60 R⊕ to an early orbit at 10 R⊕, Earth's day would have been about 7 hr long, giving an Earth likely stable against chaotic obliquity fluctuations. \n",
      "486: (294) Though the original claims for life reported δ 13 C ≈ –28‰ ( Schidlowski 1988 , Mojzsis et al. 1996 ), more recent analysis of the graphite particles with a larger number of samples has found the signature to be considerably more varied, ranging from δ 13 C of –18 to +2‰ ( Ueno et al. 2002 ). \n",
      "487: (294) Various practical arguments against galactic spaceflight becoming commonplace have been countered through the invocation of either genetic engineering ( Hart 1985 ) or artificial intelligence in the form of self-replicating and evolving von Neumann machines ( von Neumann 1966 , Tipler 1980 ). \n",
      "488: (295) How many of those candidates fail to form a Jupiter because the disk out of which the comets and planets accrete gets truncated or falls off in mass so quickly beyond a certain heliocentric distance that the inner planets do not experience much impact flux after a very early heavy bombardment? \n",
      "489: (295) The new Allen Telescope Array (ATA), if funded to completion, should allow 10 5 –10 6 stars to be searched, across an even greater frequency range, over a decade of observing at sensitivities comparable to that Phoenix attained at the Arecibo radiotelescope ( Tarter 2001 , Ekers et al. 2002 ). \n",
      "490: (296) This is appropriate, for our approach to the search for life elsewhere is influenced by our knowledge of life on Earth, and our understanding of the origin and evolution of life on Earth is informed by our study of conditions on other worlds and of Earth's solar system and galactic environment. \n",
      "491: (297) There is a standard set of arguments in the field that have now been repeated for a full century, beginning with Alfred Russel Wallace (1904) , the codiscoverer of the theory of evolution, and subsequently revived at intervals since ( Simpson 1964 , Gould 1989 , Mayr 1995 , Ward Brownlee 2000 ). \n",
      "492: (298) Of course, this does not demonstrate that Earth's rotational period would have been this short had the Moon never formed; it is difficult to estimate Earth's primordial rotation in the absence of the putative Moon-forming impact [see Lissauer, Dones Ohtsuki (2000) for a discussion of the issues]. \n",
      "493: (298) The difficulty in deciphering Mayan texts on Earth—a feat finally accomplished in part because of extant descendants still speaking related languages—is a reminder that deciphering any electromagnetic message that might one day be received could prove enormously difficult ( Finney Bentley 1998 ). \n",
      "494: (299) Brasier et al. (2002) find the filamentous structures in several different geologic clasts as well as the surrounding chert matrix, challenging the argument ( Schopf 1993 ) that the structures represent fossils preserved in an older unit that was then transported and redeposited in a bedded chert. \n",
      "495: (299) Here we emphasize that modern strategies, such as the SETI Institute's Project Phoenix, do not assume so-called magic frequencies but rather scan literally billions of microwave frequencies with narrow bandwidths while allowing for frequency drift and rigorously excluding terrestrial interference. \n",
      "496: (299) The odontocete superfamily Delphinoidea (dolphins, porpoises, belugas, and narwhals) forms the upper range of odontocete EQ values from the middle Miocene to the present; four species of dolphins with a mean EQ 0.67 of 4.6 are the most highly encephalized species on the planet after modern humans. \n",
      "497: (300) Life has evolved to weave together complex sequences of reactions, some with ΔG > 0, but whose sum results in an overall decrease in G. By fixing carbon and other elements into complex molecules, life does create local decreases in entropy that represent stored energy, or a state of disequilibrium. \n",
      "498: (300) Milankovitch (named for the twentieth-century Serbian astrophysicist Milutin Milankovitch) cycles—climatic cycles driven by variations in eccentricity, changes in obliquity, and precession—are important for both Earth and Mars ( Touma Wisdom 1993 ; Laskar, Levrard Mustard 2002 ; Head et al. 2003 ). \n",
      "499: (301) (Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are maintained within the range yielding surface temperatures that allow liquid water via a negative feedback involving CO 2 removal by rainfall, precipitation as carbonates, and resupply to the atmosphere due to volcanism subsequent to carbonate subduction.) \n",
      "500: (301) The first scenario he considers, however, is one in which Jupiter does not form because the surface density of the circumstellar gas-dust disk at >5 AU falls off so quickly that the mass of cometesimals in the Jovian region and beyond is too low for objects bigger than “terrestrial planets” to form. \n",
      "501: (303) Encephalization is typically expressed as a quotient (hence, encephalization quotient, or EQ) that quantifies how much smaller or larger a particular animal's brain is compared to the expected (via a regression over many animals) brain size for an animal of that body size ( Marino, McShea Uhen 2004 ). \n",
      "502: (306) Gogarten, Doolittle Lawrence (2002) have argued that rRNA genes themselves may have experienced large-scale gene transfer and thus “perhaps rRNA genes appear to be such useful molecules for prokaryotic taxonomy precisely because they are mosaics and reflect the mosaic character of the genome as a whole.” \n",
      "503: (306) Stable isotope geochemistry is the only technique to which appeal can be made to argue for evidence of life at 3.8–3.9 Gya ( Schidlowski 1988 , Mojzsis et al. 1996 , Rosing 1999 ), because these ancient rocks have been so heavily metamorphosed that fossil evidence cannot have survived to the present day. \n",
      "504: (306) Though the answer may be difficult to guess a priori, by breaking the calculation down into a product of numbers whose order of magnitude may be estimated (such as the population of Chicago, the number of people per family, the fraction of families that own pianos, etc.) one can make a credible estimate. \n",
      "505: (308) “Astrobiology” avoids the combination of Greek and Latin roots in “exobiology,” but has the drawback of seeming to imply that one is somehow studying the biology of stars ( astron is from the Greek for star), so seems a less appropriate combination than its cousin words astrophysics or even astrochemistry. \n",
      "506: (310) Because carbon-based molecules and useful sources of energy are common (though not ubiquitous) throughout the solar system, whereas for some time it appeared that liquid water might prove to be quite rare off of the Earth, the search for life in the solar system came to emphasize the search for liquid water. \n",
      "507: (310) However, sources of chemical disequilibrium driven by charged-particle radiation ( Chyba Phillips 2001 , Chyba Hand 2001 ) or possible hydrothermal vents ( McCollom 1999 ) can be identified, though the biomass these sources could maintain would be at least several orders of magnitude below that of the Earth. \n",
      "508: (314) An interior liquid water ocean is consistent with models of features on Europa's geologically young surface ( Pappalardo et al. 1999 ) and, most compellingly, magnetometric measurements of time-varying electrical currents in Europa's interior induced by Jupiter's rotating magnetic field ( Kivelson et al. 2000 ). \n",
      "509: (315) If in general τ l ≪ τ ⊙ , then it would be surprising for the first system observed to have τ l ≈ τ ⊙ [and, we might add, τ l ≪ τ ⊙ could not hold in any case, for reasons (such as the Earth's early magma ocean; Solomatov 2000 ) having to do with the utter uninhabitability of the Earth for its first ∼10 8 years]. \n",
      "510: (317) Were it not for subduction and volcanism (much—but not all—of which is driven by plate tectonics) the hot, metal-rich, reducing environment of the mantle would not regularly contact the oxidized sediments of the surface, and opportunities for the creation of environments in chemical disequilibrium would be reduced. \n",
      "511: (320) Similarly, in the absence of a general theory of the nature of living systems (which may or may not prove possible), neither analysis of the features that we currently associate with life nor attempts to postulate a definition for it are likely to yield a particularly informative answer to the question “what is life?” \n",
      "512: (320) Claims for the Earth's oldest fossils have been made for ∼3.5 Gya filamentous structures in both the Apex cherts [granular, sedimentary silica (SiO 2 )] of the Warrawoona Group of Western Australia ( Schopf Packer 1987 , Schopf 1993 ) and the Onverwacht Group, Barberton Mountain Land, South Africa ( Walsh Lowe 1985 ). \n",
      "513: (320) But the latter was determined by the specific kinetic energies (velocities) of accreting planetesimals in the terrestrial feeding zone, and the planetesimal velocities in their Keplerian orbits depended on the mass of the Sun—which also determines the Sun's lifetime, as stellar luminosity is a strong function of mass. \n",
      "514: (324) Subsequent to that time, the heavy bombardment, and in particular impacts of objects large enough to have evaporated Earth's oceans, could have frustrated the origins of life until ∼3.8–3.9 Gya ( Sagan 1974 , Maher Stevenson 1988 ), although such conclusions vary with the statistics of small numbers ( Sleep et al. 1989 ). \n",
      "515: (324) Brasier et al. (2002) reinterpret the microfossil-like structures as the byproduct of amorphous graphite mixing with metal-rich hydrothermal vein cherts and volcanic glass, and cite several examples of branched filamentous structures, which they argue rebuts the morphological claim that these derive from ancient bacteria. \n",
      "516: (324) These authors emphasize the contingency of evolution, how if one were to replay the evolution of animals since the late Precambrian some 600 Mya, the results would likely be very different, and in particular “the chance becomes vanishingly small that anything like human intelligence would grace the replay” ( Gould 1989 ). \n",
      "517: (325) Discussion of the prospects of life or intelligent life in the universe have been strongly influenced in recent years by the anthropic emphasis on the special nature of the Earth, and how observation selection effects prevent us from naively extrapolating the terrestrial environment or evolutionary history to other worlds. \n",
      "518: (329) But interpreting this result as evidence of the contingent or fragile nature of biology is misleading if we do not also ask in what other ways the total system would have to have been different for that single element to be missing now, and also what parallel paths there might have been to outcomes similar to the original one. \n",
      "519: (330) Over the Cassini mission lifetime (assuming an extended mission), Saturn will complete approximately one quarter of an orbit, allowing observations of Titan as the southern hemisphere summer comes to a close and temperatures warm toward the equatorial regions, perhaps revealing more clues about processes that shape the surface. \n",
      "520: (332) The total energy outburst from a Type II supernovae (stellar mass >10 M⊙) is ∼10 52 erg ( Colgate 1968 ) and the initial flash might destroy a plant's ozone layer, exposing life to direct solar UV and increased cosmic rays until the bulk of the supernovae ejecta arrived perhaps ∼10 3 years later ( Clark, McCrea Stephenson 1977 ). \n",
      "521: (334) Top Down The top-down approach to the origin of life has two foci: ( a ) deconstructing life as we know it into the smallest possible units that still exhibit some characteristics of living systems; and ( b ) mapping the genetic relationship of all life on Earth in an attempt to elucidate the properties of the last common ancestor. \n",
      "522: (334) Primary among these criticisms is that a δ 13 C of –10‰ to –12‰ in graphite can be achieved when the mineral siderite (FeCO 3 ) is thermally decomposed at temperatures above 450°C ( van Zuilen, Lepland Arrhenius 2002 ): The resulting magnetite (Fe 3 O 4 ) and istopically light graphite (C) remain in the rock while the CO 2 escapes. \n",
      "523: (334) Whether one expects substantial progress toward the origin of life in such bodies (so far not convincingly seen in meteorite samples), or whether these objects may provide natural tests of certain subsurface origin hypotheses, will depend in part on the timescale demonstrated for the origin of life on Earth ( Chyba McDonald 1995 ). \n",
      "524: (335) The utility of an agreed definition grows as science progresses toward understanding the origin of life on Earth, as laboratory experiments approach the synthesis of artificial life as measured by the criteria of some definitions, and as the search for life on Mars or Europa becomes the driver for a succession of planetary missions. \n",
      "525: (336) One of these experiments, the Labeled Release experiment, gave results that were described by the head of the Viking biology team as data that “would almost certainly have been interpreted as presumptive evidence of biology” had “information from other experiments on board the two Viking landers... not been available” ( Klein 1978 ). \n",
      "526: (336) The latter example hints that progress might be made toward resolving questions of the contingency versus convergence of intelligence if research in the area could move beyond the past century's qualitative polemics and into the realm of objective quantitative statistical tests based on the fossil record and evolutionary phylogenies. \n",
      "527: (338) In particular, the discovery of sulfate salt deposits (in particular, the mineral jarosite) and geological cross-bedding patterns 4 at the Opportunity Rover landing site of Meridiani Planum has led the science team to conclude that the region was once exposed to a considerable volume of liquid water ( MER 2004 , Squyres et al. 2004b ). \n",
      "528: (339) Corresponding to the high EQ values, there is evidence for convergent behavioral abilities between toothed whales ( odontoceti , which include dolphins) and humans, for example in mirror self-recognition ( Reiss Marino 2001 ) and intergenerational transmission of behaviors that have been described as cultural ( Rendell Whitehead 2001 ). \n",
      "529: (340) Carl Sagan (1970) catalogued a list of failed attempts, including physiological, metabolic, biochemical, genetic, and thermodynamic definitions, and there have been other attempts as well [for only a few among many more recent discussions, see Feinberg Shapiro (1980) , Joyce (1994) , Koshland (2002) , and Schulze-Makuch Irwin (2004) 1 ]. \n",
      "530: (345) The development of spectroscopy and its subsequent placement on a firm scientific basis by quantum mechanics in the early twentieth century allowed Payne-Gaposchkin ( Payne 1925 ) to demonstrate in her PhD thesis the chemical homogeneity of the stars and their similarity to Earth, apart from large differences in hydrogen and helium abundance. \n",
      "531: (345) Because of the selection bias of the Doppler radial velocity technique that is used to discover all but a few of these, nearly all have minimum masses (the measurement determines the planet's mass times the sine of its unknown obital inclination relative to us) consistent with being gas giants—in the range 0.1 to 13 times the mass of Jupiter. \n",
      "532: (345) The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) In the face of the unknowns facing the large-number, anthropic, and Fermi-paradox arguments for the prevalence of intelligent life elsewhere, it is reasonable to adopt an empirical strategy and conduct a scientific search for extraterrestrial technical intelligence ( Cocconi Morrison 1959 ). \n",
      "533: (347) The average value of L in the Galaxy might be anywhere in this interval, so that uncertainties in L alone introduce at least an eight-order-of-magnitude uncertainty into estimates of N. However, it is the average value of L that matters; if only a small fraction of intelligent civilizations have a large L, the average could still be very large. \n",
      "534: (349) We only comment that galactic colonization scenarios have shown a faith in exponential reproduction and a lack of attention to what one might call ecological factors, such as the evolution of predation (S.R. Palumbi, private communication) or other behavior that could have the effect of reducing the rate of expansion of a space-faring population. \n",
      "535: (350) Planetary Protection The United States and other space-faring nations are bound by the 1967 Outer Space Treaty ( Rauf et al. 2000 ) to “pursue studies of outer space including the moon and other celestial bodies, and conduct exploration of them so as to avoid their harmful contamination and also adverse changes in the environment of the Earth....” \n",
      "536: (351) Assuming biomass yields comparable to those of terrestrial organisms, and taking the martian biotic layer to be ∼100 m deep and evenly distributed over the planet, they find average cell densities of ∼10 -1 –10 -2 cm -3 , ∼10 5 times below the sensitivity of the Viking spacecraft GCMS and ∼10 10 times lower than densities in rich terrestrial soils. \n",
      "537: (352) The latter explanation now appears a consequence of cosmology, with the idea that our universe (so our big bang) is but one episode, a kind of bubble in a “multiverse,” which gives rise to an extremely large number of universes with different values of physical constants and different cosmic histories ( Linde 1986 , 1990 ; Leslie 1996 ; Rees 2001 ). \n",
      "538: (352) The end of plate tectonics and volcanism may have greatly undercut the habitability of Mars by, inter alia, shutting down the negative climate feedback of the CO 2 cycle ( Kasting Catling 2003 ) and probably greatly reducing the surface availability of biologically useful sources of chemical disequilibria to a low level ( Weiss, Yung Nealson 2000 ). \n",
      "539: (353) Precautions must therefore be taken to prevent the confounding of spacecraft life-detection experiments by viable (or dead) microorganisms carried from Earth, as well as to prevent the risk of introducing microorganisms that could successfully invade possible martian or europan ecosystems ( National Research Council 1992 , 2000 , 2005 ; Chyba 2003 ). \n",
      "540: (354) Livio's attempted rebuttal to Carter's argument is not decisive, and our analogy is hardly ironclad, but they are reminders that in our present state of ignorance regarding the nature of life, the origin of life, and the evolution of intelligence, it is premature to express confidence that evolutionary timescales and stellar lifetimes are independent. \n",
      "541: (360) But with a sufficiently large database of EQ measurements for fossil whales species, one can further begin to test quantitatively familiar assertions, such as the conventional wisdom that increases in encephalization should be pervasive across groups and their component lineages because of the selective advantage that encephalization confers ( Gould 1988 ). \n",
      "542: (363) This in turn led to more attention being placed on the inventory of organics provided Earth from exogenous sources such as comets ( Chyba et al. 1990 ; Thomas, Chyba McKay 1997 ) and interplanetary dust particles ( Chyba Sagan 1992 ), suggesting a possible connection between the terrestrial origin of life and interstellar chemistry ( Ehrenfreund et al. 2002 ). \n",
      "543: (364) At a minimum, several species of marine mammals, which last shared a common ancestor with our own primate lineage over 90 Myr ago, have developed a level of intelligence that by objective, quantifiable measures is well in excess of that of chimpanzees and slightly in excess of that of homo habilis , one of modern humans' tool-using predecessors ( Marino 1996 ). \n",
      "544: (366) The inference is made ( Ward Brownlee 2000 , Gonzalez Richards 2004 ) that complex life must therefore be rare, on the grounds of the assertion that Earths with Moon-size satellites must be rare, and that in the Moon's absence wild obliquity fluctuations would occur that would render the environment too inconstant for the evolution of complex or intelligent life. \n",
      "545: (368) Upon landing, the probe returned images of what appear to be water-ice rocks and data from the surface penetration instrument may indicate a thin crust covering a material similar to wet clay (inspiring a colorful “crème brûlée” analogy.) Analyses from the gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer confirm that CH 4 is, indeed, one of the major compounds in this material. \n",
      "546: (369) 3. “LIFE AS WE KNOW IT” There are currently three ways that scientists search for extraterrestrial life: ( a ) in situ (and ultimately, sample return) searches within the solar system; ( b ) the spectral examination of planetary (and soon, extrasolar planetary) atmospheres for chemical evidence of life; and ( c ) searches for evidence of extraterrestrial technology. \n",
      "547: (372) Palumbi (2001) argues that humans have become Earth's “greatest evolutionary force” dramatically accelerating evolutionary change in other species, and a consortium of ecologists calls for a shift in ecological studies from increasingly rare undisturbed ecosystems to a future environment that “will largely consist of human-influenced ecosystems” ( Palmer et al. 2004 ). \n",
      "548: (373) For example, why should self-replicating and evolving von Neumann machines not evolve to prey on one another—the effect of which would be to create a trophic ecology (a food chain) among von Neumann machines and, by standard ecological equations ( Maynard Smith 1968 ), to reduce their rate of population increase and therefore the rate of their spread through the galaxy? \n",
      "549: (373) Though there are good reasons for transmitting civilizations in the Galaxy to favor microwave frequencies within the electromagnetic spectrum, cases can be made for searching at other frequencies as well ( Ekers et al. 2002 ) or for altogether different kinds of interstellar messaging ( Tarter 2001 ), including physical artifacts ( Papagiannis 1978 , Rose Wright 2004 ). \n",
      "550: (374) The phylogenetic evidence at most suggests that the last common ancestor lived in such an environment, and it could be that the heavy bombardment to which early Earth was subject created an “impact bottleneck” through which only those organisms living in the deep (and therefore hot) subsurface could have survived ( Sagan 1974 , Maher Stevenson 1988 , Sleep et al. 1989 ). \n",
      "551: (380) Moreover, well before it permits the reengineering of the human species, biotechnology will put great power for potential terrorist acts into the hands of small groups of the technically competent, and we do not have adequate models from Cold War arms control or nuclear nonproliferation for how we are to prevent disaster in this new world ( Chyba 2002 , Chyba Greninger 2004 ). \n",
      "552: (383) Spores of Bacillus subtilis protected against solar radiation survived one year at the ∼25% level and six years at the ∼1% level on the European Retrievable Carrier (EURECA) and NASA's Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) space missions, respectively ( Horneck, Bücker Reitz 1994 ; Horneck et al. 1995 ; for a review of these and other relevant data see Mileikowsky et al. 2000 ). \n",
      "553: (388) Perhaps primordial RNA evolved in a “naked” environment and then later managed to create a self-containing envelope that was advantageous for selection in new environments ( James Ellington 1995 ); but it seems likely that RNA was in fact preceded by some other replicating system, as RNA is so difficult to make under realistic prebiotic conditions (Shaprio 1988, Chyba McDonald 1995 ). \n",
      "554: (392) Assuming that an extraterrestrial probe would have a size below 10 m, Freitas (1985) estimated that over 99.999% of heliocentric orbital space and 99.96% of the surface area in the Solar System remained unexplored to the level of resolution that would be required to detect such a probe; these percentages would be somewhat smaller now but not enough so to change the qualitative conclusion. \n",
      "555: (400) There have been suggestions that planets around such red dwarfs—the most abundant stars in the Galaxy—might be unsuitable for life, because the habitable zone lies so close to the parent star that any planet within it would be spin locked, so its atmosphere would catastrophically condense out (collapse) on its dark side unless its atmosphere were “exceedingly rich” in CO 2 ( Ward Brownlee 2000 ). \n",
      "556: (403) The counterarguments are now equally familiar ( Sagan 1977 , Gould 1985 , Conway Morris 2003 ): convergence is frequently observed in terrestrial evolutionary history, and nature has evolved complex phenomena such as eyesight and flight many times, so that even though any given evolutionary line might seem highly contingent, a large number of parallel paths might lead to the same functional outcome. \n",
      "557: (407) In its modern version, the Fermi paradox maintains that if other civilizations exist in the Milky Way Galaxy, some must be much older (perhaps by billions of years) than ours; that such civilizations would long ago have developed interstellar travel; that they would then have explored or colonized the Galaxy on a timescale short compared with the Galaxy's lifetime; and that they would therefore be here. \n",
      "558: (412) Nevertheless, such machines may become so numerically powerful that they can strongly mimic an autonomous intelligence [see Searle (1984) for why it is unconvincing to make the familiar positivistic claim that this is “the same thing” as their being intelligent], or an altogether different approach to artificial intelligence that sidesteps the syntax/semantics dichotomy facing digital computers may be found. \n",
      "559: (415) The vast bulk of the primordial soup work to date ( Wills Bada 2000 ) has at its root the same general hypothesis: if we take prebiotically plausible simple molecules (e.g., hydrogen-rich compounds such as CH 4 and ammonia, NH 3 ) and apply energy (e.g., spark discharge, UV irradiation, or an impact shock), larger building blocks leading toward life will be synthesized (e.g., amino acids or nucleic acid bases). \n",
      "560: (421) The challenge to many of these solutions is the large-number assertion: Although this or that explanation might explain the failure of some, even most, civilizations to colonize the Galaxy, the timescale for colonization is putatively so short ( Jones 1976 , von Hoerner 1978 , Tipler 1980 ) that unless the total number of civilizations in galactic history were quite small, the Galaxy would indeed have been colonized. \n",
      "561: (437) We should not exaggerate the ease or casualness with which substantial genetic manipulation of human beings will be done, but it is undeniable that basic measures of human bioengineering capability, such as the time or cost required to sequence or synthesize DNA oligomers ( Carlson 2003 ), show that biotechnology is exponentially advancing at a rate as fast or faster than that of Moore's law ( Moore 1965 ) in computing ( Figure 2 ). \n",
      "562: (445) All the proposed definitions face problems, often in the form of robust counter-examples ( Chyba McDonald 1995 ); for example, metabolic definitions of life find it hard to exclude fire (which grows and even reproduces through chemical reactions that are essentially the same as those used by some organisms), and thermodynamic definitions find it hard to exclude mineral crystals (which create and sustain local order, and may also reproduce). \n",
      "563: (445) Because of the liquid water requirement of terrestrial life, the search for life in our solar system has focused on those objects where liquid water may now exist, or may once have existed: Mars ( Kargel 2004 ) and Europa, as well as other large icy satellites that may harbor subsurface oceans ( Chyba Phillips 2005 ), and the possibly once-liquid deep interiors of large asteroids ( Chyba McDonald 1995 ) and comets ( Podolak Prialnik 1997 ). \n",
      "564: (453) [There is now observational evidence that large planetesimal collisions in other solar systems are common at the end of planetary accretion ( Rieke et al. 2005 ), but, of course, there are currently no statistical data about the frequency or nature of planet–moon combinations that may result.] But again one must ask what Earth may have been like had the Moon never formed—not what the Earth would look like if today one somehow plucked away the Moon. \n",
      "565: (461) Originally it was claimed that the proposed microfossils represented ancient cyanobacteria within a sedimentary, stromatolitic environment, but it now appears that the Apex chert may be hydrothermal in origin (which may call the cyanobacterial interpretation into question, but does not in itself rule them out as microfossils), opening the possibility that the structures might also be explained by physical processes resulting in chains of crystal formation. \n",
      "566: (473) In any event, whether through biological engineering of the human intellect, advances in human/machine interfacing, or the invention of autonomous machine intelligence, some observers ( Bernal 1929 , Vinge 1993 ) argue that we are about to enter a realm where technical intelligence (and its own subsequent directed evolution) advances so quickly that it will be impossible for contemporary human beings to play a significant role in the resulting subsequent civilization. \n",
      "567: (594) The Drake equation is , where N is the number of technically communicative civilizations in the galaxy, R * is the rate of star formation in the galaxy, f p is the fraction of those stars around which planets form, n e is the number of planets in such systems suitable for the origin of life, f l is the fraction of those planets on which life actually originates, f i is the fraction of those on which life evolves intelligence, f c is the fraction of those that become communicative across interstellar distances, and L is the average lifetime of a communicative civilization ( Sagan 1973 ). \n"

      "INTRODUCTION The study of supernovae (SNe) has expanded tremendously during the past decade. \n",
      "A major motivation, of course, was provided by SN 1987A, by far the most thoroughly observed supernova (SN) in history. \n",
      "Advances in the field have also been driven by technology: The advent of sensitive detectors, especially charge-coupled devices (CCDs), and the proliferation of moderately large telescopes made it possible to obtain excellent photometry and spectroscopy of large numbers of SNe. \n",
      "In addition to their intrinsic interest, SNe are relevant to nucleosynthesis and galactic chemical evolution, the production of neutron stars and black holes, the origin of cosmic rays, the physical state of the interstellar medium, and induced star formation; thus, they have been investigated from a wide range of perspectives. \n",
      "Finally, the enormous potential of SNe as cosmological distance indicators is inspiring many new studies. \n",
      "This review concentrates primarily on the observed optical spectra of SNe, illustrating the temporal evolution of the major classes and subclasses. \n",
      "When combined with other observations and properly interpreted, such data can reveal the chemical composition of the ejecta, the nature of the progenitors, the explosion mechanisms, and even the distances of SNe. \n",
      "Optical light curves are briefly summarized; it is difficult to entirely decouple discussions of the photometric and spectral evolution of SNe. \n",

      "GENERAL OVERVIEW OF SUPERNOVAE Spectra Supernovae occur in at least three, and possibly four or more, spectroscopically distinct varieties. \n",
      "The two main classes, Types I and II, were firmly established by Minkowski (1941 , but see Popper 1937) . \n",
      "Type I SNe are defined by the absence of obvious hydrogen in their optical spectra, except for possible contamination from superposed H II regions. \n",
      "SNe II all prominently exhibit hydrogen in their spectra, yet the strength and profile of the Hα line vary widely among these objects. \n",
      "Until recently, most spectra of SNe have been obtained near the epoch of maximum brightness, but in principle the classification can be made at any time, as long as the spectrum is of sufficiently high quality. \n",
      "Only occasionally (Section 5.5) do SNe metamorphose from one type to another, suggesting the use of hybrid designations. \n",
      "The early-time ( t ≈ 1 week) spectra of SNe are illustrated in Figure 1 . \n",
      "The lines are broad owing to the high velocities of the ejecta, and most of them have P Cygni profiles formed by resonant scattering above the photosphere. \n",
      "SNe Ia are characterized by a deep absorption trough around 6150 Å produced by blueshifted Si II λλ6347, 6371 (collectively called λ6355). \n",
      "Members of the Ib and Ic subclasses do not show this line. \n",
      "Members of the Ib and Ic subclasses do not show this line. The presence of moderately strong optical He I lines, especially He I λ5876, distinguishes SNe Ib from SNe Ic ( Wheeler Harkness 1986 , Harkness Wheeler 1990 ). \n",
      "Figure 1 Spectra of SNe, showing early-time distinctions between the four major types and subtypes. \n",
      "The parent galaxies and their redshifts (kilometers per second) are as follows: SN 1987N (NGC 7606; 2171), SN 1987A (LMC; 291), SN 1987M (NGC 2715; 1339), and SN 1984L (NGC 991; 1532). \n",
      "In this review, the variables t and τ represent time after observed B-band maximum and time after core collapse, respectively. \n",
      "The ordinate units are essentially “AB magnitudes” as defined by Oke Gunn (1983) . \n",
      "The late-time ( t ≳ 4 months) optical spectra of SNe provide additional constraints on the classification scheme ( Figure 2 ). \n",
      "SNe Ia show blends of dozens of Fe emission lines, mixed with some Co lines. \n",
      "SNe Ib and Ic, on the other hand, have relatively unblended emission lines of intermediate-mass elements such as O and Ca. \n",
      "Emission lines in SNe Ib are narrower ( Filippenko et al 1995b ) and perhaps stronger ( Wheeler 1980 ) than those in SNe Ic, but these conclusions are based on the few existing late-time spectra of SNe Ib, and no other possibly significant differences have yet been found. \n",
      "At this phase, SNe II are dominated by the strong Hα emission line; in other respects, most of them spectroscopically resemble SNe Ib and Ic, but the emission lines are even narrower and weaker ( Filippenko 1988 ). \n",
      "The late-time spectra of SNe II show substantial heterogeneity, as do the early-time spectra. \n",

      "Notation is the same as in Figure 1 . The parent galaxy of SN 1987L is NGC 2336 ( cz = 2206 km s −1 ); others are listed in the caption of Figure 1 . \n",
      "At even later phases, SN 1987A was dominated by strong emission lines of Hα, [O I], [Ca II], and the Ca II near-IR triplet, with only a weak continuum. \n",
      "At ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, all SNe I exhibit a very prominent early-time deficit relative to the blackbody fit at optical wavelengths (e.g. Panagia 1987 ). \n",
      "This is due to line blanketing by multitudes of transitions, primarily those of Fe II and Co II ( Branch Venkatakrishna 1986 ). \n",
      "The spectra of SNe Ia (but not of SNe Ib/Ic) also appear depressed at IR wavelengths ( Meikle et al 1997 ). \n",
      "The early-time spectra of most SNe II, in contrast, approximate the single-temperature Planck function from UV through IR wavelengths, with occasionally even a slight UV excess. \n",
      "SN 1987A was an exception: The earliest IUE spectra showed a strong UV deficit relative to the blackbody curve defined at optical wavelengths ( Danziger et al 1987 ), as in SNe I. Light Curves Some representative optical light curves of SNe are shown by Minkowski (1964) ; much more complete atlases of SNe I and SNe II are given by Leibundgut et al (1991c) , Patat et al (1993) , respectively. \n",
      "The most obvious conclusion is that to first order, the light curves of SNe I are all broadly similar, whereas those of SNe II exhibit much dispersion. \n",
      "Despite their bewildering variety, the majority of early-time light curves of SNe II ( t ≲ 100 days) can be usefully subdivided into two relatively distinct subclasses ( Barbon et al 1979 , Doggett Branch 1985 ). \n",
      "The light curves of SNe II-L (“linear”) generally resemble those of SNe I, whereas SNe II-P (“plateau”) remain within ∼1 mag of maximum brightness for an extended period ( Figure 3 ). \n",
      "The degree to which there is a continuity between SNe II-L and SNe II-P is still debated, and other possible classification schemes are being considered ( Patat et al 1994 ). \n",
      "The plateau of SN 1992H, for example, was somewhat shorter than usual and declined with time in the VRI passbands, and it was barely visible or nonexistent in B and U, leading Clocchiatti et al (1996a) to call this a hybrid object. \n",
      "Figure 3 Schematic light curves for SNe of Types Ia, Ib, II-L, II-P, and SN 1987A. \n",
      "The curve for SNe Ib includes SNe Ic as well, and represents an average. \n",
      "For SNe II-L, SNe 1979C and 1980K are used, but these might be unusually luminous. \n",
      "From Wheeler 1990 ; reproduced with permission. \n",
      "From Wheeler 1990 ; reproduced with permission. The peak absolute magnitudes of SNe II-P show a very wide dispersion ( Schmitz Gaskell 1988 , Young Branch 1989 ), almost certainly due to differences in the radii of the progenitor stars. \n",
      "Most SNe II-L, on the other hand, have a nearly uniform peak absolute magnitude ( Young Branch 1989 , Gaskell 1992 ), ∼2.5 mag fainter than SNe Ia, although a few exceptionally luminous SNe II-L (SN 1979C, and to a lesser extent SN 1980K) are known. \n",
      "At late times ( t ≳ 150 days), the light curves of most SNe II resemble each other, both in shape and absolute flux ( Turatto et al 1990 , Patat et al 1994 ). \n",
      "The decline rate is close to that expected from the decay of Co 56 to Fe 56 (0.98 mag/100 days), especially in V. The light curve of SN 1987A ( Figure 3 ), although unusual, was generically related to those of SNe II-P; the initial peak was low because the progenitor was a blue supergiant, much smaller than a red supergiant ( Arnett et al 1989 and references therein). \n",
      "Additional objects of a possibly similar nature are SN 1909A ( Young Branch 1988 ) and SNe 1923A, 1948B, and 1965L ( Schmitz Gaskell 1988 ). \n",
      "Some SNe II decline very slowly at early times (Section 5.4), probably because of energy radiated during the interaction of the ejecta with circumstellar gas (e.g. SN 1987F, Chugai 1991 ; SN 1988Z, Turatto et al 1993b , Chugai Danziger 1994 ); they do not fit into the two main photometric subclasses. \n",
      "Indeed, they appear to constitute a subclass that is also spectroscopically distinct (SN IIn; Section 5.4). \n",
      "Barbon et al (1973 , their Figure 1 ) illustrate the B-band light curves of 38 SNe I on a single plot, after having adjusted them in both coordinates to minimize the dispersion. \n",
      "There is considerable scatter, some of which is due to intrinsic differences among SNe Ia (Section 3.3). \n",
      "Moreover, three SNe now known to have been SNe Ib (1962L, 1964L, 1966J), as well as some number of unrecognized SNe Ib/Ic, were included in this compilation, yet their light curves are not identical to those of SNe Ia. (Note that the archaic “SNe Ia” and “SNe Ib” of Barbon et al, defined according to photometric properties, should not be confused with the modern, spectroscopic designations.) SNe Ic 1987M and 1994I, for example, declined markedly faster than SNe Ia ( Filippenko et al 1990 , Richmond et al 1996b ), whereas the decline rate of the few SNe Ib that have been studied appears to be slower than that of SNe Ia ( Schlegel Kirshner 1989 , Kirshner 1990 ). \n",
      "Clocchiatti Wheeler (1997) recently found that the light curves of SNe Ic cluster into two different categories: Some fall more slowly than SNe Ia (like SNe Ib), and others more rapidly, even though they have nearly identical spectra. \n",
      "This serves as an important reminder that light curves can provide physical diagnostics not available from spectra alone. \n",
      "It is appropriate at this point to mention Zwicky's (1965) SN Types III, IV, and V, all of which had peculiar light curves. \n",
      "Each of these classes has only a few known examples, and in all cases their spectra showed hydrogen. \n",
      "As stated by Oke Searle (1974) , Doggett Branch (1985) , they should therefore be considered as SNe II (or peculiar SNe II), at least until additional objects that have similar characteristics are found and examined in detail. \n",
      "SN 1961V in NGC 1058 (Type V) had the most bizarre light curve ever recorded. \n",
      "The less luminous SN 1954J, also known as Variable 12 in NGC 2403, had a light curve shape similar to that of SN 1961V; see Humphreys Davidson (1994) . \n",
      "SNe V may not even be genuine SNe, a conclusion reached by Goodrich et al (1989) , Filippenko et al (1995a) for the specific case of SN 1961V; rather, they may be super-outbursts of luminous blue variables such as η Carinae. \n",
      "Environments and Progenitors The locations at which SNe occur provide important clues to their nature and to the mass of their progenitor stars. \n",
      "SNe II, Ib, and Ic have never been seen in elliptical galaxies and rarely if ever in S0 galaxies. \n",
      "They are generally in or near spiral arms and H II regions ( Huang 1987 , Porter Filippenko 1987 , Van Dyk 1992 , Van Dyk et al 1996a ), implying that their progenitors must have started their lives as massive stars (≳8–10 ). \n",
      "SNe Ia, on the other hand, occur in all types of galaxies, including ellipticals, and in spirals there is no strong preference for spiral arms ( Maza van den Bergh 1976 , Van Dyk 1992 , McMillan Ciardullo 1996 ; but see Bartunov et al 1994b ). \n",
      "Because SNe Ia occur most frequently in spiral galaxies, with the rate per unit K-band (2.2 μm) luminosity increasing from early to late Hubble types ( Della Valle Livio 1994 ), the majority of SNe Ia probably come from intermediate-age (∼0.1–0.5 billion years), moderately massive stars (4–7 ); see Oemler Tinsley (1979) for an interesting early discussion. \n",
      "The progenitors of SNe Ia are carbon-oxygen white dwarfs that accrete matter from a companion star and undergo thermonuclear runaway ( Nomoto et al 1984 , Woosley Weaver 1986 , and references therein). \n",
      "Although the white dwarfs probably reach the Chandrasekhar limit prior to exploding, this is not yet certain ( Woosley et al 1994 , Livne Arnett 1995 , but see Höflich et al 1996a ). \n",
      "SNe II are thought to arise from evolved, massive progenitors (initial mass ≳8–10 ) that suffer core collapse (generally iron) and subsequently rebound (e.g. Arnett et al 1989 ), leaving a neutron star or perhaps in some cases a black hole ( Brown Bethe 1994 ). \n",
      "Most workers now believe that SNe Ib/Ic are produced by the same mechanism as SNe II, except that the progenitors were stripped of their hydrogen (SN Ib) and possibly helium (SN Ic) envelopes prior to exploding, either via mass transfer to companion stars ( Nomoto et al 1994 , Woosley et al 1995 ) or through winds ( Woosley et al 1993 , Swartz et al 1993b , and references therein). \n",
