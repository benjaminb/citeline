      "76 53 4. OTHER METHODS FOR INFERRING SOLAR ABUNDANCES 4.1. \n",
      "77 54 The same holds for Tl ( Lambert, Mallia Smith 1972 ). \n",
      "78 60 Both have disappeared with the 3D solar model ( Figure 6 ). \n",

      "80 64 Such models come in two flavors: theoretical and semiempirical. \n",
      "81 65 In addition, photoionization cross sections play a crucial role. \n",
      "82 65 Table 1 Element abundances in the present-day solar photosphere. \n",
      "83 65 Even the Li i resonance line at 670.8 nm is therefore very weak. \n",
      "84 65 Not surprisingly, the agreement with our new value is very good. \n",
      "85 66 In this context it is perhaps fair to say that “better is worse.” \n",
      "86 66 To date, there has been no fully convincing solution put forward. \n",
      "87 67 They also determined an isotopic ratio of 12 C/ 13 C = 86.8 ± 3.8. \n",
      "88 68 Furthermore, photospheric abundances are not observed but inferred. \n",
      "89 69 Recently, Vitas et al. (2008) have revisited the solar In abundance. \n",
      "90 70 For the atomic transitions, departures from LTE have been considered. \n",
      "91 71 Not surprisingly, B does not appear depleted in the solar photosphere. \n",
      "92 72 In particular, very little isotopic abundance information is available. \n",
      "93 72 The one glaring absence is a study of non-LTE effects for this element. \n",
      "94 73 Table 3 Representative isotopic abundance fractions in the Solar System. \n",
      "95 74 Unfortunately, no reliable oscillator strengths are available for Cr ii . \n",
      "96 74 Same as above but with the 1D semiempirical Holweger Müller (1974) model. \n",
      "97 76 Unfortunately, the gf -values for Mg i and Mg ii are notoriously uncertain. \n",
      "98 77 All intensities are normalized to the corresponding disk-center intensities. \n",
      "99 77 Finally, dust condensation needs to be taken into account for some elements. \n",

      "559 236 Although the situation has greatly improved compared to the solar abundances of Grevesse Sauval (1998) and earlier compilations, there is still a tendency for the solar C, N, and Fe abundances to be somewhat higher than in the B stars. \n",
      "560 236 Also with the Grevesse Sauval (1998) abundances there was a disagreement in this region but it is greatly aggravated by the further lowering of the solar O and Ne abundances and, to a lesser extent, by the reassessment of C, N, and Fe. \n",

      "573 241 This is not too surprising, because these strong rotation lines are formed in very high atmospheric layers, which are the most challenging to model realistically owing to, for example, magnetic fields, non-LTE, and nonequilibrium chemistry. \n",

      "581 246 They estimated the amount of missing opacity by requiring that the nearby OH electronic lines would return the same O abundance as the OH vibrational lines in the IR, which increased the derived photospheric Be abundance to the meteoritic value. \n",

      "586 250 The remaining few elements that suggest a significant difference between meteorites and the Sun can probably be attributed to poor solar determinations, likely owing to incorrect gf -values, unidentified blends, or unaccounted/wrong non-LTE effects. \n",

      "589 252 The reason that these so-called large-eddy simulations are nevertheless quite successful in reproducing the real photosphere is that the mean stratification is largely independent of numerical resolution ( Stein Nordlund 1998 ; Asplund et al. 2000a ). \n",
      "590 253 Ayres (2008) revisited the 630-nm line with a single snapshot of another 3D model but found a 0.12 dex higher O abundance, partly because he allowed the Ni i gf -value to vary freely in spite of the new accurate measurement by Johansson et al. (2003) . \n",
      "591 253 Although the Ne abundance (log ε Ne = 7.96 ± 0.13) of Bochsler (2007) agrees with ours, there are significant additional uncertainties in this result on account of using He as a reference element, as it is known to be highly variable in the solar wind. \n",
      "592 253 Owing to the combined effects of thermal diffusion, gravitational settling, and radiative acceleration (often referred to collectively as diffusion) over the past 4.56 Gyr, the values in Table 1 differ slightly from the protosolar chemical composition. \n",

      "602 257 Whether the problem will be traced in the end to shortcomings in the atmospheric or interior modeling remains to be seen, but whatever the resolution it will place solar and stellar astrophysics—and, by extension, most of astronomy—on a much firmer footing.\n",

      "606 261 Interestingly, they argued that it is important to take into account the line asymmetry of the Fe i +Ni i blend introduced by the convective motions (e.g., Asplund et al. 2000b ), which otherwise would lead to an overestimation of the Th abundance by ≈0.1 dex. \n",
      "607 262 Together with the solar wind ratio 3 He/ 4 He = (4.53 ± 0.03) × 10 −4 from Genesis measurements ( Heber et al. 2008 ), the Jovian ratio implies D/H = (1.96 ± 0.03) × 10 −5 ; most of the uncertainty comes from the poorly known He fractionation in the solar wind. \n",
      "608 266 Given that the problem exceeds the likely uncertainties in existing input data (e.g., opacities, diffusion, abundances), the only remaining option on the solar interior side seems to be to invoke some physical process not yet accounted for in standard solar models. \n",
      "609 267 With the solar chemical composition recommended here ( Table 1 ), the situation is somewhat alleviated owing to the slightly higher abundances of these elements and consequently larger opacity in the radiative interior, but the deviation is still highly significant. \n",
      "610 267 As discussed by Asplund (2005) , even though departures from LTE are expected to be relatively serene in the Sun, one should always expect non-LTE abundance corrections at around the 0.05 dex level; indeed in many cases the effects will be significantly more severe. \n",
      "611 267 Significant headway will only become possible with the advent of detailed photoionization and collisional cross sections; for the latter, estimates of the impact of both electron and H collisions, as well as other processes like charge transfer, are urgently needed. \n",
      "612 268 Most of these differences can be attributed to the improvements over the past two decades in modeling the solar atmosphere, allowing for departures from LTE in the line formation, properly treating blends, and employing improved atomic and molecular data (Section 2). \n",
      "613 270 There have been noteworthy improvements in this respect in recent years through the Opacity and Iron Projects ( Badnell et al. 2005 ), for example, but unfortunately the lack of quantum mechanical calculations for most elements preclude detailed non-LTE investigations. \n",

      "617 272 Although perhaps unlikely to cure the problem by itself, it is wise to bear in mind that a similar situation for pulsating stars in fact existed in the 1980s, which found an unexpected resolution with the more comprehensive calculations by the OPAL and OP collaborations. \n",
      "618 273 Higher atmospheric layers, to which the strongest atomic and molecular lines are more sensitive, are naturally less constrained observationally; on the modeling side this requires improved radiative transfer treatment and allowance of departures from LTE for key elements. \n",

      "621 274 Future Issues Although major progress has been made in recent years in the inferred solar chemical composition, there is no question that a great deal of work remains before we can confidently state that each solar elemental abundance is known to better than 0.01 dex (2%). \n",
      "622 275 Using the improved 3D model atmosphere, we find stark disagreement between LTE abundances from Ti i and Ti ii (Ti i : log ε Ti = 4.85 ± 0.06, Ti ii : log ε Ti = 4.99 ± 0.04), though with very low scatter from each species individually ( σ = 0.03 for both ionization stages). \n",
      "623 276 Observational Constraints on Solar Modeling Because more sophisticated modeling does not automatically imply a more realistic outcome, it is of paramount importance to carefully test the predictions of the 3D model atmospheres against an arsenal of observational diagnostics. \n",

      "625 276 We note that only 1D non-LTE abundance corrections have been employed for the C i results, while the departures from LTE are expected to be exacerbated in the presence of atmospheric inhomogeneities ( Asplund 2005 ); a full 3D non-LTE study for C would clearly be worthwhile. \n",
      "626 276 Mn i shows moderate non-LTE effects (about +0.06 dex), consistent with its ionization potential being intermediate between the lower values seen in the lighter members of the iron group Sc, Ti, V, and Cr and the higher values exhibited by the heavier elements Fe, Co, and Ni. \n",
      "627 276 Because the various solar oscillation p-modes penetrate to different depths, it is possible to map the variation of the sound speed in the solar interior, which can be compared to the predicted values from solar structure models (see Basu Antia 2008 , for a detailed review). \n",
      "628 278 With the downward revision of the overall metal content presented here compared to the Grevesse Sauval (1998) abundances, the previous excellent agreement between predicted sound speeds from standard solar models and those inferred from helioseismology is ruined (Section 4.3). \n",
      "629 280 Interestingly, the corrected version of such a temperature structure would be more similar to the MISS semiempirical model ( Allende Prieto et al. 2001 ); both semiempirical models have a shallower temperature gradient than 1D theoretical model atmospheres, as seen in Figure 1 . \n",
      "630 281 Our Fe i -based abundance of log ε Fe = 7.52 ± 0.05 ( σ = 0.03) from weak lines is slightly higher than in Asplund et al.

      "633 283 We have updated this analysis with the new 3D model and find that the effects of the increased Ni i proportion and the shallower model temperature gradient in comparison with Allende Prieto, Lambert Asplund (2001) compensate for one another, leaving the abundance at log ε O = 8.66. \n",
      "634 284 The predicted non-LTE abundance corrections are little dependent on the model atmosphere in question, be it 1D or 3D ( Asplund et al. 2004 ), but they do depend on the adopted collisional cross sections, in particular the inelastic H collisions (e.g., Kiselman 1993 , Asplund 2005 ). \n",
      "635 285 The advent of improved transition probabilities for Fe ii lines (e.g., Hannaford et al. 1992 ; Schnabel, Kock Holweger 1999 ) and a proper treatment of pressure broadening (e.g., Anstee, O'Mara Ross 1997 ; Barklem, Piskunov O'Mara 2000a ) strengthened the case for a low Fe abundance. \n",

      "643 296 Although all the utilized transitions are from the majority ionization stage (once ionized) for the rare Earth elements, one still expects a minor temperature and, thus, model-atmosphere dependency, because the lines originate from atomic levels with low excitation potentials ( χ exc ≤ 1.5 eV). \n",

      "645 299 It should be emphasized that this excellent agreement cannot be interpreted as an absence of any significant diffusion in the Sun (Section 3.11), as the meteoritic scale is set by Si; all elements heavier than He are fractionated by ≈0.04 dex relative to H but hardly at all relative to each other. \n",

      "657 315 In the absence of any non-LTE study, we favor Ti ii in Table 1 by taking the mean of the two results weighted according to their total uncertainties (Scott et al., in preparation); we only retain any weighting for the Ti i result because of the sheer number of excellent lines and oscillator strengths it includes. \n",
      "658 316 The most unsatisfactory situation, however, relates to collisional cross sections for excitation and ionization, for which laboratory or theoretical calculations are completely missing bar for a few elements and transitions relevant for spectroscopy of late-type stars (e.g., Belyaev Barklem 2003 ; Barklem 2007a ). \n",
      "659 316 We have found very good agreement (0.02 dex) with recent studies using the Holweger Müller (1974) model when allowance is made for differences in adopted transition probabilities and equivalent widths for Ge ( Biémont et al. 1999 ), Sr ( Barklem O'Mara 2000 ), Pd ( Xu et al. 2006 ), and Pb ( Biémont et al. 2000 ). \n",
      "660 317 In spite of the remaining uncertainties in solar photospheric determinations, having access to the most accurate solar abundances possible is crucial, not only for understanding our own Sun but also in order to make meaningful comparisons with other stars (for which meteoritic information is obviously unavailable). \n",
      "661 317 Both the Ne/O ratio (0.20 ± 0.03) and the absolute Ne abundance (log ε Ne = 8.08 ± 0.03) estimated in this way are in very good agreement with the solar values we adopt here when the effects of solar diffusion and Galactic chemical enrichment over the past 4.5 Gyr are accounted for ( Przybilla, Nieva Butler 2008 ). \n",
      "662 318 As seen in Figure 3 , with 3D hydrodynamical models for the solar atmosphere, it is now possible to achieve highly satisfactory agreement with observed profiles of typical weak and intermediate strong lines (the wings of strong lines reveal more about the pressure broadening data than the employed model atmosphere). \n",
      "663 321 Rather than solving for many thousands of frequency points as regularly done in theoretical 1D hydrostatic models, the wavelength variation of opacity is represented by a small number of typical opacity bins (4–20) in order to compute the radiative heating/cooling rate that enters the energy equation ( Nordlund 1982 ). \n",
      "664 321 Interestingly, we conclude that the forbidden [S i ] 1082-nm line returns too high an abundance by 0.3 dex, which may signal an unidentified blend, non-LTE effects, or that the theoretical transition probability is in error, whereas Caffau Ludwig (2007) found excellent agreement with the meteoritic value for this line. \n",
      "665 321 An alternative approach makes use of the measured enrichment of the 3 He/ 4 He ratio in the solar wind in comparison with the protosolar ratio 3 He/ 4 He = (1.66 ± 0.05) × 10 −4 inferred from Jupiter ( Mahaffy et al. 1998 ), because the additional 3 He can be attributed to D-burning in the Sun ( Gloeckler Geiss 2000 ). \n",
      "666 321 Surprisingly, Ayres, Plymate Keller (2006) found strongly subterrestrial ratios (e.g., 16 O/ 18 O = 440 ± 20) from their analysis of the solar CO lines, probably owing to an inadequate consideration of the differing temperature sensitivities of the isotopomer transitions with 1D model atmospheres ( Scott et al. 2006 ). \n",
      "667 323 Fortunately, there has been some laudable progress on this score in recent years, in terms of both experimental efforts (e.g., Johansson et al. 2003 , Blackwell-Whitehead Bergemann 2007 , Lawler et al. 2009 ) and theoretical calculations (e.g., Kurucz 1992 , Plez 1998 , Badnell et al. 2005 ), as discussed in Section 2.2. \n",
      "668 328 It should be noted that except for C and O, the isotopic fractions given here are the more conservative “representative isotopic composition” values from the compilation of Rosman Taylor (1998) , in contrast to Lodders (2003) , who opted for the “best measurement from a single terrestrial source” data from the same reference. \n",
      "669 329 We follow the procedure of Lodders (2008) but employ our preferred values for the photospheric abundances of O (for the solar wind, flares, and energetic particles), Kr, and Xe (for analyses of Jupiter), and the lower He abundance appropriate for the upper atmosphere instead of the photospheric value (for solar wind analyses). \n",
      "670 332 The remaining three elements, Rh, Ag, and Pb, have had their photospheric values determined from transitions originating either in the ground state or from low-excitation levels of the neutral species (also true for Pd, W, and Au), which are prone to non-LTE effects in their excitation and ionization populations ( Asplund 2005 ). \n",
      "671 334 The solar Ca abundance can be determined from both Ca i and Ca ii ( Lambert Luck 1978 ), although there are problems with both species: Most of the Ca i lines are rather strong, whereas the uncertainties in the transition probabilities for the Ca ii lines are still unsatisfactorily large (Opacity Project data assuming LS-coupling). \n",
      "672 334 We note that care should be exercised when comparing our solar results with corresponding abundances for late-type stars derived with classical 1D model atmospheres; ideally a differential study of the stars and the Sun should be performed; the solar abundances presented in Table 1 should be used to place them on an absolute scale. \n",
      "673 337 Reassuringly, when the same input data are adopted (e.g., line strengths, non-LTE corrections), the Caffau et al. (2008a) analysis is in excellent agreement with ours, which shows that the exact choice of 3D model is of relatively little consequence for the permitted O i lines; indeed quite similar results are obtained with 1D models. \n",
      "674 340 An intense debate long raged as to whether the solar Fe abundance inferred from Fe i lines should be log ε Fe ≈ 7.7 (e.g., Blackwell, Lynas-Gray Smith 1995 ) or log ε Fe ≈ 7.5 (e.g., Holweger, Kock Bard 1995 ), with the choice of equivalent widths, gf -values, microturbulence parameters, and pressure-damping constants all playing a role. \n",
      "675 342 A similar procedure has been implemented for Cd ( Youssef, Doenszelmann Grevesse 1990 ), W ( Holweger Werner 1982 ), Os ( Quinet et al. 2006 ), Ir ( Youssef Khalil 1988 ), and Au ( Youssef 1986 ), all of which have only heavily blended transitions available in the solar spectrum, necessitating careful and time-consuming spectrum syntheses. \n",
      "676 342 The interpretation is, however, complicated by the so-called first ionization potential (FIP) effect: Elements with ionization potential χ ion 10 eV are enhanced in the upper solar atmosphere and solar wind compared to their photospheric values, whereas the high ionization elements are not or only slightly affected ( Feldman Widing 2003 ). \n",
      "677 344 Bahcall, Basu Serenelli (2005) estimated that a factor of three (0.5 dex) higher Ne content compared to the recommended values of Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , together with minor adjustments of C, N, O, and Ar within their associated uncertainties, would restore the good agreement found with the Grevesse Sauval (1998) solar composition. \n",
      "678 347 For completeness, we note that the He abundances recommended by Anders Grevesse (1989) and Grevesse Noels (1993) were based on calibration of solar models and, hence, corresponded to bulk composition; here we have substituted those with the helioseismic convection zone He content (Section 3.9) when computing the present-day photospheric values. \n",
      "679 347 A major problem, however, is the dearth of atomic physicists devoted to satisfying the astronomical need for various types of input data; the astronomical community ought to better appreciate and encourage the relatively few individuals carrying out this important work, given its tremendous benefit for solar and stellar astrophysics especially. \n",
      "680 351 The recommended solar abundances provided in Table 1 for these elements have been modified from the original sources by calculating the abundance difference between a 3D hydrodynamical model atmosphere and the Holweger Müller (1974) model, each computed using the same line-formation code with consistent input data (Grevesse et al., in preparation). \n",
      "681 352 Bahcall et al. (2005) estimated that a 10–20% increase of the OPAL opacities over a relatively substantial fraction of the solar interior ( R = 0.4–0.7 R ⊙ or equivalently T = 2–4 × 10 6 K) would be required; Christensen-Dalsgaard et al. (2009) found even slightly more stringent requirements with the Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) solar abundances. \n",
      "682 353 1. Holweger (2001) found log ε O = 8.71 ± 0.05 using the Holweger Müller (1974) model with granulation corrections estimated from a 2D solar model, whereas Asplund et al. (2004) obtained a 0.07-dex lower abundance from a 3D non-LTE study; the main difference, however, between the two studies is the adopted H collisions ( S H = 1 and 0, respectively). \n",
      "683 355 A preliminary N abundance was given in Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) using high-excitation N i lines and NH vibration-rotation lines in the IR, whereas in our final analysis also NH-pure rotation lines and a multitude of transitions from various bands of CN have been considered in the framework of an improved 3D model (Sauval et al., in preparation). \n",
      "684 361 We note a significant improvement for W compared to previous compilations of the solar chemical composition [Δlog ε = +0.49 dex in Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , whereas here the difference amounts to +0.20 dex]; we suspect that unidentified blends and/or erroneous continuum placement may be at fault for the persisting discrepancy, likewise for Rb and Hf. \n",
      "685 373 Below we present in some detail how the abundances were derived but the full description of the analysis (including line lists with all relevant data for the transitions) will appear in a forthcoming series of articles in Astronomy Astrophysics (Asplund et al., in preparation; Grevesse et al., in preparation; Sauval et al., in preparation; Scott et al., in preparation). \n",
      "686 378 Furthermore, the resulting He abundance when calibrating solar interior models to achieve the correct solar luminosity and temperature at the solar age is similarly inconsistent with the value inferred from helioseismology (see Section 3.9): Y S ≈ 0.238 compared to the observed 0.2485 ± 0.0034 ( Basu Antia 2004 ), where Y S is the present-day He mass fraction at the surface. \n",
      "687 387 For all other neutron capture elements (Cu, Zn, Ga, Ge, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Sn, Ba, Pb, and Th), the adopted abundances come from a complete 3D-based reanalysis using the best atomic data and newly measured equivalent widths or spectrum synthesis for the most reliable lines (Grevesse et al., in preparation); the case of Ru is also discussed in Fivet et al. (2009) . \n",
      "688 396 Another important advancement in recent years is that it is now possible to accurately compute the pressure broadening (also known as van der Waals broadening) of metal lines ( Anstee O'Mara 1995 ; Barklem, Piskunov O'Mara 2000a ; Barklem Aspelund-Johansson 2005 ), which has made the classical Unsöld broadening and its ad hoc enhancement factors largely obsolete, at least for neutral species. \n",
      "689 400 As discussed in detail by Lodders (2008) , there are a wide range of methods for inferring the solar Ar abundance: solar wind measurements, solar flares and energetic particles, nuclear statistical equilibrium with the abundances of the nearby α -elements 28 S and 40 Ca, and comparison with other Solar System objects (Jupiter) and the Solar Neighborhood (B stars, planetary nebulae, H ii regions). \n",
      "690 406 We should bear in mind that most large-scale abundance analyses of Galactic thin disk stars to date (e.g., Edvardsson et al. 1993 ; Reddy et al. 2003 ; Bensby et al. 2005 ; Ramírez, Allende Prieto Lambert 2007 ; Fuhrmann 2008 ) have been performed differentially relative to the Sun to remove the uncertainties from gf -values and to minimize systematic errors due to inadequacies in the stellar modeling. \n",
      "691 408 From the pioneering efforts of Russell (1929) , Suess Urey (1956) , and Goldberg, Müller Aller (1960) to the more recent works of Anders Grevesse (1989) , Grevesse Sauval (1998) , Lodders (2003) , Asplund, Grevesse Sauval (2005) , Grevesse, Asplund Sauval (2007) , and Lodders, Palme Gail (2009) , compilations of the Solar System abundances have found extremely wide-ranging use in astronomy and cosmology. \n",
      "692 415 Bear in mind that there exists an ambiguity when employing any 1D model: Although many simply adopt temperatures, pressures, and densities directly from the published model, a more correct procedure is to perform a pressure-integration using only the temperature structure as a function of continuum optical depth, in order to be consistent with the opacities computed with the spectrum synthesis code one employs. \n",
      "693 431 There are a wide range of potential sources of error in solar and stellar abundance analyses, from inaccurate input data for the transition ( gf -values, line broadening, etc.) to difficulties in estimating line strengths (finite signal-to-noise, continuum placement, blends, etc.), to inadequacies in the atmospheric and line-formation modeling (1D, LTE, mixing length and microturbulence parameters, continuous opacities, etc.). \n",
      "694 432 In most cases, the terrestrial isotopic abundance ratios as recommended by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ( Rosman Taylor 1998 ) have been adopted as representative of the Solar System values; direct solar isotopic information can only be gleaned from CO vibration-rotation lines in the IR spectrum of the Sun (e.g., Scott et al. 2006 ), although with comparatively large error bars by terrestrial standards. \n",
      "695 448 Because the transition arises from the ground state of a minority species, the line is sensitive to both the temperature and photoionizing UV radiation field ( Kiselman 1997 , Asplund 2005 ) The recommended value given in Table 1 stems from the analysis of Müller, Peytremann de La Reza (1975) , which has been corrected for the effects of atmospheric inhomogeneities and 3D non-LTE effects ( Asplund et al. 1999 , Barklem, Belyaev Asplund 2003 ). \n",
      "696 454 Table 2 The derived photospheric solar C, N, and O abundances for the available indicators using different solar model atmospheres a a The results have been obtained with a 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere as well as with the temporally and spatially (over equal optical depth surfaces) averaged 3D model (denoted 〈3D〉), the 1D theoretical MARCS model ( Gustafsson et al. 2008 ), and the 1D semiempirical model of Holweger Müller (1974) . \n",
      "697 586 In a beautiful series of papers, they have systematically and methodically measured radiative lifetimes, branching fractions, oscillator strengths, isotopic shifts, and hyperfine constants for all the rare Earth elements: La ( Lawler, Bonvallet Sneden 2001 ); Ce ( Lawler et al. 2009 ); Pr ( Sneden et al. 2009 ); Nd ( Den Hartog et al. 2003 ); Sm ( Lawler et al. 2006 ); Eu ( Lawler et al. 2001b ); Gd ( Den Hartog et al. 2006 ); Tb ( Lawler et al. 2001a ); Dy ( Sneden et al. 2009 ); Ho ( Lawler, Sneden Cowan 2004 ); Er ( Lawler et al. 2008 ); Tm, Yb, and Lu ( Sneden et al. 2009 ). \n",
      "698 868 [Throughout this review, we adopt the customary astronomical scale for logarithmic abundances where H is defined to be log ε H = 12.00, that is, log ε X = log( N X / N H ) + 12, where N X and N H are the number densities of elements X and H, respectively.] Figure 4 shows how the solar abundances vary with atomic number, illustrating several key features of nuclear and stellar physics: the high primordial H and He abundances; the fragile nature of Li, Be, and B; the relatively high abundance of elements involved in stellar H-, He-, and C-burning, modulated by the odd-even effect and the α -capture effect; the high nuclear binding energy and near-nuclear statistical equilibrium for the Fe-peak; and the production of the heavy elements through successive neutron captures with peaks around the magic nuclei possessing closed neutron shells (e.g., Pagel 1997 ). \n"
